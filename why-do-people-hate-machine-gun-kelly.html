If only the "Jawbreaker" knew how to keep himself out of trouble ...</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>What do rap and pop-punk have in common? Before you answer, we'll just tell you that in the middle of the bizarre Venn diagram lies <a href=#>Machine Gun Kelly.</a> The musician initially released the mixtapes "Stamp of Approval" (2006), "Homecoming" (2008), "100 Words and Running" (2010), and "Lace Up" (2010), which gained enough traction to earn him a record deal with Diddy's label, Bad Boy Records.</p><p>Back then he was known as an up-and-coming rapper, but these days MGK's music has leaned away from hip-hop.</p><p>If you turn on a mainstream radio station in 2021, you'll undoubtedly hear MGK's songs "my ex's best friend" and "I think I'm OKAY," both of which align more with alternative music. Whether he's a brilliant musical chameleon or a sellout, one thing seems to be clear: People seem to hate the dude, specifically, people on the internet.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Throughout his highly publicized relationship with living, breathing, goddess <a href=#>Megan Fox</a>, the disdain for Machine Gun Kelly, whose real name is Colson Baker, has only been magnified. So, where does the hate stem from? Let's dive in.</p><p>"When I first signed Machine Gun Kelly I knew he was going to be a star. I didn‚Äôt know how exactly we‚Äôd get there but I knew it would happen," Diddy wrote in a now-deleted Instagram post. That's an interesting way to put it.</p><p>No matter how you spin it, Puff Daddy was right. Whether you love him or hate him, you can't deny Machine Gun Kelly's stardom, but it's said growing stardom that went to his blond head.</p><p>The musician and actor, who actually killed it as the antagonist in 2016's Nerve, just can't seem to keep his black tongue in his mouth. While he's rumored to be rude and crude to fans, not to mention <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sometimes violent</a>, and has even spit vodka into a fan's mouth (at a pre-COVID 2012 show), MGK doesn't stop there.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by the Blonde Don (@machinegunkelly)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@machinegunkelly</a></figure><p>Before performing his song "Jawbreaker" on the last day of Chicago's Riot Fest 2021, Machine Gun Kelly started trash-talking a little metal band known as Slipknot, who also performed at the festival.</p><p>‚ÄúHey, you wanna know what I‚Äôm really happy that I‚Äôm not doing? Being 50 years old wearing a f--king weird mask on a f--king stage, talkin' s--t. So anyway, what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favorite candy? Reese‚Äôs Pieces?‚Äù he exclaimed onstage. Wowza. Did he learn nothing from his 2018 feud with Eminem?</p><p>Slipknot fans practically gave themselves carpal tunnel with how quickly they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dragged MGK</a> on Twitter. While the incident initially seemed unprompted, it's more likely that MGK was a bit salty about what Slipknot's lead singer, Corey Taylor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sassily said</a> on the Cutter‚Äôs Rockcast podcast in February 2021.</p><p>"I hate all new rock for the most part. I [hate] the artists who failed in one genre and decided to go rock ‚Äî and I think he knows who he is. But that's another story," Corey stated, assumedly targeting MGK.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>MGK is the biggest joke of a musician literally ever üòÇ dudes music sucks so bad he has to resort to starting beef to get some spotlight.

MGK wasn't too shy to tweet that Corey's verse was cut for being "f--king terrible," which almost instantly prompted Corey to release text receipts between himself and drummer Travis Barker, who co-produced MGK's said album.</p><p>According to the texts, Corey wrote, "I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the right guy for the track. Nothing personal, I just think if this is what MGK is looking for, someone else is the guy to do it. It‚Äôs ALL good, and I‚Äôm stoked for him.‚Äù The whole squabble has us cringing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>megan fox, look at me‚Ä¶look at me, this isn‚Äôt you</p>‚Äî aaron (@clownnoises) <a href=#>October 13, 2021</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@clownnoises</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox have been dating since 2020.</h2><p>Hollywood's newest "power couple" can't seem to keep their hands or tongues off each other. "I just remember this tall, blond, ghostly creature and I looked up and I was like, 'You smell like weed.' He looked down at me and he was like, 'I am weed,'" Megan Fox actually, literally told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>.</p><p>Despite MGK allegedly declaring, "I am weed," during his very first encounter with the ethereal Jennifer's Body star, their love seems unbreakable.</p><p>Meg even calls him her "Blond Angel Baby," which is gag-worthy. But in a rare vulnerable moment, Machine Gun Kelly opened up about what his deep relationship with Megan has done for his life.</p><p>"I came from broken homes, and I watched love never work," he told GQ in Oct. 2021. "It hurts my soul that I wasted 30 years of my life not having any desire. Dude, I was down to die," he said of his life before Megan. "Love gave me a reason to stay here."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by the Blonde Don (@machinegunkelly)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@machinegunkelly</a></figure><p>No matter what your stance is on the "papercuts" singer, we wish him the best in his mental health journey.
