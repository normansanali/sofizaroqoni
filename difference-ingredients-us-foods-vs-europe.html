I'm not saying I'm proud of this fact, but if you were to put a delicious <a href=#>avocado toast</a> with eggs meal in front of me and a microwavable burrito that'll be cooked all unevenly with varying temperature points that range from arctic cold to magma hot, I'll instinctively reach for the burrito. There's something about pre-packaged <a href=#>foods</a> that bring me so much joy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Maybe it has something to do with convenience, or the fact that growing up these foods were too expensive for my family to enjoy (peasant soup and filling our own water from upstate New York water sources in old, glass wine jugs was my upbringing), but I'm a sucker for any kind of prepared food.</p><p>And while there have been major strides in the last few years from food distributors that have seen an uptick in healthier prepared food options, the fact remains that a lot of these items are still bad.</p><p>And I don't mean "bad" in that they don't provide some instant flavor gratification (I find them delicious), but they're not necessarily the best things for you to put into your body. They're usually loaded with preservatives and a litany of ingredients that are almost impossible to pronounce.</p><p>But this isn't the case everywhere.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Twix</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>After looking at the differences in "junk food" labels, I noticed some startling variations in the USA labels with their U.K. counterparts.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Heinz ketchup</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This struck me as odd for many reasons, the first being that a lot of these brands were either founded in the United States or gained immense popularity here.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Campbell's tomato soup</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A lot of these foods, like Campbell's tomato soup, are unapologetically "American" and are intertwined with our collective culture.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cool Ranch Doritos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So why is it that the U.K. and European versions of these foods have inarguably "better" ingredients?

They ban or add warning labels to these additives for their citizens. The U.S. takes the opposite approach. It does not remove additives from our food supply until they have been proven dangerous â€“ which can take a very long time and a lot of red tape. <strong>This means Americans are literally the lab rats</strong>."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So there you have it, we're the food "guinea pigs" when it comes to ingredients in foods. Personally, I'm interested in doing a taste test between these popular foods. Thanks to e-commerce, I'll be able to order the U.K. versions of these popular food items and see if I can taste a difference without freaking myself out upon reading the ingredients list.
