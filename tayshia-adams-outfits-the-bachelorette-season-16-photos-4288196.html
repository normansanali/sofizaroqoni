Although Tayshia came into this season two weeks late following&nbsp;<strong>Clare Crawley’s</strong> decision to leave the show and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>get engaged</a>, she’s definitely delivered in the fashion department throughout her tenure. Whether it’s getting glammed up for a rose ceremony, or keeping it casual, but still sexy, during an outdoor date, Tayshia totally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>nailed every look</a> she wore this season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tayshia-adams-sexiest-looks-bachelorette-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, this season of&nbsp;The Bachelorette was fully filmed at the La Quinta Resort in Palm Springs. Since it was the middle of summer, it was sizzling hot every single day, so Tayshia really had to pull out all the stops to keep cool. Of course, that meant lots of time spent in a bikini. From the very first day she arrived, Tayshia was looking fabulous in her two-piece by the resort’s pool, and she wore swimsuits, crop tops and shorts for several of her dates this season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tayshia-adams-sexiest-looks-bachelorette-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Tayshia also loved flowy dresses to beat the heat during the daytime. For one of her day dates, she rocked a short, halter top dress, which was cinched at her midsection with a studded band. The loose fabric had a lace trim, and was perfect for the steaming hot temperatures. Somehow, Tayshia’s makeup and hair managed to still look perfect in the heat, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tayshia-adams-sexiest-looks-bachelorette-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>When it came to rocking evening gowns for rose ceremonies, Tayshia also hit it out of the park. For her very first night as the Bachelorette, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she showed up</a> in a stunning, beaded backless dress. The outfit hugged every inch of her body, and wrapped around her neck in a halter style. Needless to say, the guys were blown away from the moment she walked in the room!
