The&nbsp;6'9" giant is a fairly unorthodox athlete, and, as Sophia Ankel of <a href=#>Business&nbsp;Insider</a> tells us, he has struggled with addiction, mental health issues, weight gain, and a tendency to make controversial statements, all of which have arguably given him at least as much trouble as his opponents have.
