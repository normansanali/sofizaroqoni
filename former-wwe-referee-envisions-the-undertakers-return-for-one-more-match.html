He hasn’t wrestled in a long time but&nbsp;now a former WWE referee also believes The Phenom has it in him to compete in one more match.</p><p>The Deadman remained a fixture on WWE television for over three decades, with a significant presence since the early ’90s. In the late ’90s, he was an unstoppable force as the World Champion. However, even his championship status couldn’t <a href=#>shield him from Vince McMahon’s fury</a>.</p><p>The WWE Hall of Famer officially put an end to his in-ring career at Survivor Series in 2020. His final match occurred at WrestleMania 36 the same year, where he emerged victorious in a Boneyard match against AJ Styles.</p><p>While speaking on the <a href=#>Monday Mailbag</a> podcast, former WWE referee Mike Chioda talked about The Undertaker competing in the ring again. Chioda made it clear that he believes The Deadman has what it takes to compete in a match again.</p><p>“Taker looks in great shape. I know he’s had some surgeries done. I think they were successful and the hip replacement and all that and so forth. I think he’s got one more match in him, but please make him go over. Don’t do the match unless you’re going over dead man. F*** building anybody else up. Let them work on their own building themselves up. I hope he does do one more match. I could see him doing one more match.”</p><p>Mike Chioda isn’t the only one who thinks like this as <a href=#>Jim Ross also believes The Undertaker can compete in one last match</a>. Only time will tell whether The Undertaker will come out of retirement for one last match.</p><p>What do you think of what Mike Chioda said? Do you feel The Undertaker can still come back for one last match?
