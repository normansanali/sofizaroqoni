Social media users have been interested in everything from Dahmer's <a href=#>family dynamic</a> to his<a href=#> IQ score</a> since he was nowhere close to an A+ student. And there is plenty of curiosity about his appearance, including his eyes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you were able to stomach watching the Netflix series, you likely noticed that Dahmer (played by <a href=#>Evan Peters</a>) had eerie yellow eyes in a certain scene. And while production and wardrobe teams are known to play up certain elements in order to intensify a character, viewers are wondering if the yellow eyes were natural. So, what was Jeffrey Dahmer’s eye color? Here’s the lowdown.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeffrey Dahmer is said to have had blue eyes.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sticky Facts</a>, Jeffrey Dahmer had blue eyes.</p><p>Other members of the blue-eyed serial killer group include <a href=#>Ted Bundy</a> and Susan Wright, the one the Houston community and beyond refers to as the blue-eyed butcher, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sentinel Record</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, where do Jeffrey Dahmer’s yellow eyes come into play? Did Dahmer have two different-colored eyes?</h2><p>If you paid attention to the Netflix series, you'll likely recall that Dahmer had a pretty eerie scene where his eyes appeared yellow. However, since Dahmer was known to have blue eyes, viewers have been a bit confused.</p><p>Luckily, it’s pretty simple and Dahmer explained it himself, via the Netflix series.</p><p>In Episode 2, Dahmer told 14-year-old victim <a href=#>Konerak Sinthasomphone</a> that his yellow contacts were a small homage to the Emperor in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, whom he idolized, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Dahmer went on to tell Sinthasomphone that he purchased the contacts at a pawn shop. This followed the teen waking up in Dahmer’s lap in an incapacitated state as the killer looked at him with eerie yellow eyes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Interestingly, yellow eyes also have major significance which was first shown in Episode 1. After Dahmer brought his first victim to his apartment, he forced the man to watch the movie The Exorcist III with him. As Dahmer sped up to his favorite part of the film, a scene shows the killer’s bright yellow eyes right before his victim is murdered.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>So, it’s safe to assume that Dahmer felt that wearing yellow contacts would connect him to the serial killers he adores in various films. In other words, Dahmer felt invincible and powerful while wearing the yellow contacts.</p><p>Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is currently available to stream on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KnstGesGackZ26pr6MnrCeZZOkubC%2B</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
