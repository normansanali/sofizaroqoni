When Nichols reported feeling short of breath, an ambulance was dispatched.</p><p>Both the TBI and the US Department of Justice have launched inquiries into Nichols’s passing.</p><p>According to the police, as they approached Nichols, there was a conflict and another confrontation after he fled.&nbsp;</p><p>However, according to Nichols’ relatives, the officers in question were in an unmarked car and they beat him to the point that he had a cardiac arrest and kidney failure. It is currently unknown what caused his death.&nbsp;</p><p>The officers’ conduct is being investigated by the TBI to determine if it was criminal in nature.</p><p>The family of Nichols, as well as campaigners and others, are calling for the release of a video showing the events leading up to his death. They are also calling for the officers involved in his killing to be fired and prosecuted.&nbsp;</p><p>The family has expressed their support for the termination of the officers and according to investigators working on an internal assessment of the arrest, the officers breached standards for use of force, duty to intervene, and duty to offer help.</p><p>According to Nichols’ father, Rodney Wells, he was just a block away from his house when he was pulled over by the police.&nbsp;</p><p>Tyre was a skateboarder, the father of a 4-year-old son, and an innocent man, according to Nichols’ brother, Jamal Miller. He had never been in any trouble before. The <a href=#>family</a> is now demanding answers and justice for the death of their loved one.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDA2KucZqaZmLWwuNJmn6iroJ7BoriMqZ%2BorJ9k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
