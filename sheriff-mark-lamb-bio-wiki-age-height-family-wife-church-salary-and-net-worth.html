On January 1st, 2017, Lamb was elected as the 24th Sheriff of Pinal County. His style of leading certainly is different than that of his predecessors, but Lamb said that’s by design.</strong></p><p>On a regular basis, Lamb can be seen embodying the persona of the “American Sheriff,” complete with jeans and a cowboy hat. Lamb says the getup is twofold: It’s the manifestation of the Old West sheriff that has a storied tradition in Arizona, and it sets him apart within the department.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of

a pleasant person since he was a boy. “I look at the bright side of things, the positive side of things”, he added. He later joined Dixie College (now Dixie State University) and played a little college baseball after high school.</p><p>Lamb, began his career at the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community at the Salt River Police Department back in 2006. He has also been with the Salt River Police Department and the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office. Regarding his dress code, Lamb said he’s worn his boots and hat before when he had a job on a dairy — “my favorite job” — but now his manner of dress differentiates himself from the deputies who serve with him. Lamb can often be found on patrol in his customary attire and said when he makes routine traffic stops or shows up on scenes, people recognize him in part because of his “uniform.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sheriff-mark-lamb-age-and-birthday></span><span>Sheriff Mark Lamb Age and Birthday</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mark Lamb was born and raised in Hilo, Hawaii but the exact date of birth is not known.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sheriff-mark-lamb-family-parents-and-siblings></span><span>Sheriff Mark Lamb Family, Parents and Siblings</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lamb is the youngest of four children he has two older brothers and a sister.

He proudly wears his faith on his sleeve, saying it helps keep him grounded.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sheriff-mark-lamb-tests-positive-for-covid-19></span><span>Sheriff Mark Lamb tests positive for Covid-19</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Arizona Governor Doug Ducey prolonged the state’s stay-at-home order into mid-May, Sheriff Mark Lamb of Pinal County countered that the order had gone on long enough.</p><p>“The numbers don’t justify the actions anymore,” he stated in an interview with The Arizona Republic in early May. “Three hundred deaths is not a significant enough number to continue to ruin the economy.”<br>Lamb told he would talk to residents in the jurisdiction near Phoenix about complying with the directive. But he would not criminally enforce it.</p><p>“I think people want to know that we’re going to support their constitutional rights,” he informed the newspaper. “I felt (Ducey) pushed me into a position where I needed to make our stance clear.”<br>Almost two months later, the sheriff published on Wednesday that he had tested positive for Covid-19.</p><p>“Unfortunately, as a law enforcement official and elected leader, we do not have the luxury of staying home,” Lamb posted on Facebook. “This line of work is inherently dangerous, and that is a risk we take when we sign up for the job. Today, that risk is the COVID-19 virus.”</p><p>Lamb explained that he had been invited to an event on Tuesday at the White House and was screened. Though he was showing no symptoms, he tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>The Sheriff likely got infected at a June 14 reelection event, he stated. Video from the event, in San Tan Valley, Arizona, shows Lamb greeting and mixing with supporters, according to the Casa Grande Dispatch.</p><p>Neither the sheriff nor the event’s attendees had their masks on in the video.</p><p>Lamb will self-isolate for at least 14 days, he announced Wednesday. The Pinal County Public Health Department was working to trace everyone he interacted with after the campaign event, he said.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mark-lamb-allegations></span><span>Mark Lamb Allegations</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lamb was accused on social media with allegations that he’s involved in extramarital activities and corruption. Tammy Marie Peacock, a woman who says she had a physical and emotional affair with Lamb, told PinalCentral she fell for Lamb, believing him to be sincere in his profession of affections.</p><p>However, Lamb disputes any affair with Peacock and cast as not credible, citing her criminal history and current unemployed status. “I’m telling you that I didn’t meet Tammy Peacock until a few months into my campaign,” Lamb said. “And I never was alone with her.”</p><p>Peacock says Lamb used her, promised her the moon and failed to deliver. Peacock shared with PinalCentral text messages of a sexual nature she says are from Lamb. But Lamb dismissed that innuendo as ridiculous, saying the only thing he’s guilty of is being overly friendly.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sheriff-mark-lamb-american-sheriff-foundation></span><span>Sheriff Mark Lamb American Sheriff Foundation</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One change Lamb made was to disassociate the department from the Arizona Public Safety Foundation, which had been mired in controversy for years. Created under then-Sheriff Chris Vasquez and continued by Babeu, the foundation provided an avenue for dozens of Pinal nonprofits to receive funds from seized money or the sale of seized property.</p><p>Soon after Lamb took office, he broke ties with the foundation but he soon created his own nonprofit foundation, aptly named the American Sheriff Foundation. He said his foundation operates as a legitimate nonprofit organization and only accepts donations, which in turn are doled out to recipients. For example, Lamb said, the foundation was in the process of purchasing a bicycle and donating it to a man who was known to walk to work in San Tan Valley. “It’s about helping our community,” Lamb said.</p><h1 style=text-align:center><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Sheriff Mark Lamb</span></h1><h2 style=text-align:left><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-sheriff-mark-lamb></span><span><strong>Who is Sheriff Mark Lamb?</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:left>Lamb is an American Law Enforcement Officer who is the 24th Sheriff of Pinal County.</p><h2 style=text-align:left><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-sheriff-mark-lamb></span><span><strong>How old is Sheriff Mark Lamb?</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sheriff Mark has not shared his date of birth with the public, as it is not documented anywhere as of 2020.</p><h2 style=text-align:left><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-sheriff-mark-lamb></span><span><strong>How tall is Sheriff Mark Lamb?</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sheriff Mark has not shared his height with the public.
