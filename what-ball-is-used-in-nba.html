It features a classic orange color with black ribbing and the NBA logo prominently displayed. The official basketball used in NBA games must adhere to specific size and weight regulations set by the league. The NBA basketball has a circumference of 29.5 inches (75 cm) and a weight of 22 ounces (620 grams). These precise measurements ensure uniformity and consistency in the game.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Materials Used</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The materials used in the construction of the NBA basketball are crucial to its performance and feel.
