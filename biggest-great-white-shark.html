And few sharks are more fascinating than Deep Blue — the biggest great white shark ever caught on camera.</p><p>Video of Deep Blue went viral back in August of 2015 after it was featured on “Shark Week,” but it turns out that the videographer behind the images, Michael Maier, was holding out on an even larger stockpile of footage. Until now.</p><p>In case you need a refresher, <a href=#>here is what we know already about Deep Blue</a>: this adult female, estimated to be around 50 years old and at least 20 feet in length, was pregnant at the time she was filmed, and, given her age, has likely birthed more than 100 great white pups.</p><p>The new video of Deep Blue, put out by Barcroft TV, reveals that the divers spent more time than previously thought with Deep Blue near the coast of Guadalupe Island, Mexico. Separated by only the bars of a shark cage, divers chum the water with chunks of meat. Deep Blue takes the bait — and gets close to treating one of the divers like a quick snack — before swimming on just feet from the brave people in the water. One diver even reaches out for a quick fin bump.</p><p>“Everything was all very well-prepared and the team felt safe,” Maier said. Of course, “safe” isn’t the first word that would come to many people’s minds while being circled by the largest great white shark ever caught on camera.</p><p>Video of Deep Blue from any other diving trip doesn’t exist, and likely won’t for quite some time — if at all — because she doesn’t have a tracking device. Scientists <a href=#>have no idea where she is now</a>.</p><p>Get ready for swimsuit season with Deep Blue possibly coming to a beach near you.</p><p>Now that you’ve seen the world’s biggest great white shark, meet the world’s <a href=# coolest sharks>.
