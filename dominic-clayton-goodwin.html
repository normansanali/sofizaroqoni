He was a loyal fan of the Dallas Cowboys for more than forty-five years and enjoyed watching the games with his family and friends.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>Nick’s heart was as big as Texas, and he could be counted on to unconditionally protect and provide for those he loved. Nick was a bright light with a million-dollar smile that lit up the spaces he occupied, and when he greeted you with a hug, the positive energy made you feel secure and loved. Nick possessed an undeniable sense of fashion and enjoyed dressing in one of his many suits, accompanied by his signature bowtie. A comedian at heart, he absolutely loved a good laugh, good food and making prank calls to his family and friends.</p><p class=p1>Nick was educated in the Norfolk Public School System and after completion of his diploma, received certification in construction advanced plumbing from the job corps in Atlanta, Georgia. Most of his career, he worked as a Brick Mason, with Sprinkle Masonry and Snow Jr. & King Inc. Nick would like you to know that his work here is done. He received a call for an assignment with unparalleled benefits – a reunion with his parents and loved ones who’ve gone on before him.</p><p class=p1>Dominic leaves to mourn and cherish precious memories; his wife, Melodie Goodwin; son, Kemper Johnson (Marshera); daughter, Dominique Goodwin; grandchildren, Endure, Ethan, Ari and D’Mauri; sisters, Adalay Wilson, Denise Dudley, Robin Majette, Rosalind Slade and Melissa Goodwin; brother, Bernard Goodwin; and a large tribe of nieces, nephews, cousins, uncles, aunts, and special life-long friends; Kelvin Freeman, Willie Freeman, Rickie Odom and Thomas Bolden.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillam%2FsLzOpaCtmZ6bwq%2Bx0ZqjrJ2iq7aksY2cpqZnnZq6sL7ImqNonJ%2Bitq%2B1wmaapZmpqbyvecaopp2vmaN8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
