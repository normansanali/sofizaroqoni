But as intriguing as Johnson appearing in a Marvel movie undoubtedly is, folks are apparently far more interested in a separate theory — the possibility of the actress getting plastic surgery.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>As previously mentioned, Johnson has already done her part as the leading lady in S.J. Clarkson’s Madame Web — which is actually set to be a project involved in Sony’s Spider-Man realm and is set to release on Valentine’s Day (Feb. 14). And with the movie just a few weeks away from landing in theaters, Johnson has quickly become the main focus, with the 34-year-old performer appearing at a Madame Web photocall earlier today in London.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>Upon release of the photos, showcasing Johnson in a gorgeous black ensemble, and a previous appearance on SNL, a fair amount of folks have started to wonder whether or not Johnson has actually had any professional work done.</p><h2 id=h-so-has-johnson-had-plastic-surgery-in-the-past data-injectable=false>So, has Johnson had plastic surgery in the past?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Madame-Web-Trailer-3.jpg><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>At the current time of this writing, there’s no exact reason to believe that Johnson has had any work done, as she herself has never confirmed these rumors. And, if there’s anything to be understood about Hollywood and ever-swirling whisperings, it’s that rumors are sometimes just that — completely fabricated. Still, the chatter has seemingly yet to waver, with certain facial observers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">examining parts of her face</a> and wondering if any plastic surgery has been performed.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>The range of these rumors touch on areas of Johnson’s face — including her nose, with folks wondering about rhinoplasty, an eyebrow lift, or lip filler injections. Again, with none of these procedures ever being confirmed by either Johnson herself or a medical physician or surgeon, it’s best to simply be satisfied with the answer that the Texas native has not had any plastic surgeries in the past.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=false>Even if plastic surgery were the case in this situation, any professional work done to a person’s face and/or body certainly does not discount their determination, talent, or work ethic — so there’s absolutely no reason to question Johnson’s abilities as a gifted actress. In fact, MCU fanatics are sure to get a divine taste of her exemplary work when the latest Sony/Spider-Man chapter hits theaters in time for the most romantic day of the year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1or%2BMnZikp6SWequ7x6eqqKZdna6lec%2BlmKysmZh6tMHRoJyroZWofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
