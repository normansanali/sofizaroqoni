"She made it sound like it was his doing, saying, 'He said he needs time to 'find himself. I don't have time for that.'" Her ex Jenner, she told friends, has "gone to Australia" for some soul-searching.</p><p>Jenner himself <a href=#>Tweeted</a> about starting "a new life" Down Under on Dec. 19. "So I decided to stay in Australia BY MYSELF!!! Hahaha this is Crazy.. Might just stay here and start a new life."</p><p>Despite the sad news, Nicole wasn't in a gloomy mood at Manor, the source says. "She didn't seem bothered by the recent breakup at all. She spent the entire night downing Jager shots and flirting with all of the guys."</p><p>Indeed, her Tweets from that night bear that out. "Rocking out at Manor" she wrote a 1:33am on Dec. 20. "Jager time!"</p><p>By 11:30am, she was feeling the effects of all those Jagermeister shots: "8 hours of sleep, too much jager= not good."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On the just-concluded fifth season of The Hills, Nicole and Jenner argued about his flirty relationship with aggressive ex-girlfriend<strong> Kristin Cavallari</strong>.
