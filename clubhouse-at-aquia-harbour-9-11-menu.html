And although the menu has been taken down, it had already made its rounds on social media — with plenty of backlash.</p><p>A tweet from Washington D.C. native Brian Sasser called the menu advertisement “appalling” for featuring items such as the “Never Forget Sampler,” “9-11 Oysters,” the “Flight 93 Redirect” hot crab dip crostini, and the “2977 Chowder” — a reference to the official death toll of the terror attacks.</p><p>And for couples who sought to try everything, the restaurant also offered a $50 “Never Forget Sampler,” which the restaurant noted would “Save $22!” on “Eats and Drinks for 2!” They even offered a themed beverage to go with their seafood specials, the “Remember-tini,” a key lime and coconut rum cocktail served up with whipped cream and a honey graham rim.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-396947 alt="Patriot Day 2022 Menu" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/patriot-day-2022-menu.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-396947 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>The Clubhouse at Aquia Harbour’s “Patriot Day 2022 Seafood Sunday” menu.</span></p><p>Other Twitter users responded, calling the menu items “vile” and “insensitive.” According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Virginia Department of Veteran Services</a>, the state is home to over 780,000 veterans, making up more than 9 percent of Virginia’s population.</p><p>“This is so awful for anyone who lost someone on 9/11 or people who watched it happen right in front of them,” <a href=# rel=noopener>tweeted</a> user Kathleen Schmidt. “I’m one of those people.”</p><p>Other reactions ranged from, “This seriously can’t be real. Is it real?” to, “I haven’t cringed this hard since the first time I saw the ‘atomic roll’ on a sushi menu.”</p><p>Other users <a href=# rel=noopener>compared</a> this very real promotion to a Subway advertisement shared by The Onion in 2018 for “Subtember 11th,” saying “You Will ‘Never Forget’ This deal.”</p><p>Of course, the biggest difference is that The Onion is a satirical news site. And in that instance, the Subway advertisement wasn’t real, but a commentary on how businesses seek to profit off the tragedy of 9/11.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-396946 alt="The Onion 9/11 Subway Ad" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-onion-911-ad.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-396946 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>The Onion/Twitter</span><span class=caption-body>A fake, satirical Subway promotion tweeted by The Onion in 2018.</span></p><p>The Clubhouse isn’t the first brand to use 9/11 for marketing, though. Others have felt the need to capitalize on the tragedy publicly on social media in the past, many of which have been collected in an article from <a href=# rel=noopener>HuffPost</a>.</p><p>Perhaps one of the more egregious examples came from another Virginia business: Bikram Yoga. The studio was one of many locations founded by yogi Bikram Choudhury, the subject of the Netflix documentary Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator who has been accused of rape, sexual assault, and racism.</p><p>In 2014, Bikram Arlington tweeted, “9 + 11 = 20% OFF! PATRIOT DAY SALE on Bikram Yoga.”</p><p>Evidently, misplaced, tone-deaf brand tweets and promotions regarding 9/11 had become so commonplace that in 2019, <a href=# rel=noopener>Fast Company</a> deemed it newsworthy to note that most companies had in fact chosen to simply remain silent — except for one “noteworthy blip” from Ledo Pizza in Annapolis, Maryland.</p><p>The pizza chain reportedly tweeted “#NeverForget,” accompanied by a photo of its square pizza, with olives and pepperoni fashioned on top to look like the American flag.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-397033 alt="World Trade Center Memorial" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/world-trade-center-memorial.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-397033 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Derek Jensen/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The World Trade Center memorial lights during the 2004 commemoration of the Sept. 11 attacks.</span></p><p>As time has passed, and as social media has become a core part of many people’s lives, brands have tried to adjust to the rapidly changing advertising sphere, often sharing tweets and social posts that sound closer to a friend’s commentary than an advertisement.</p><p>And while it may have been fun — for a time — to see companies like Wendy’s replying to users or starting beef with their competitors in a friendly back-and-forth on Twitter, it’s clear that most people today have grown wary of how brands engage with online audiences.</p><p>The widespread criticism of 9/11 marketing, brands profiting off the tragedy, and the general disillusionment and cynicism regarding brands’ social media presence combine to make The Clubhouse at Aquia Harbour’s Patriot Day menu particularly misguided.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Clubhouse’s manager George White issued a public statement, saying, “I apologize for those I offended with the 9/11 seafood Sunday post. My intention was to bring attention to that horrific day 21 years ago. To honor those who lost so much as well [as] those who gave everything that day. We will have a new theme tomorrow.”</p><p>On Wednesday morning, less than 24 hours after posting the original menu, the Clubhouse released its updated Sunday menu with a football theme. Items like the “Freedom Flounder,” “2977 Chowder,” and “Pentagon Pie” were replaced by the “Fumble Flounder,” Champ Chowder,” and “Coin Toss Chocolate Pie.”</p><p>After learning of this backfired attempt at commemorating 9/11, read about the bizarre <a href=#>9/11 conspiracy theories</a> that some people actually believe.
