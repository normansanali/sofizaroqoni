And to say that someone’s not there for the right reasons?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Love-is-Blind-Micha-v-Zack.jpg><p>Zack, 32, <a href=#>initially got engaged to Irina</a> before meeting face-to-face. However, the twosome quickly realized during the cast’s trip to Mexico that their relationship wasn’t working out. The attorney moved on with costar <a href=#><strong>Bliss Poureetezadi</strong></a> after reconnecting back in Seattle, and <a href=#>the pair tied the knot</a> during the season finale.</p><p>During the heated reunion — which was <a href=#>intended to stream live</a> on Sunday, April 16, but experienced major delays — <a href=#>Zack confronted Irina</a> and argued that she went on the show “to get famous.” Micah, meanwhile, claimed it was the other way around.</p><p>“You’ve plugged your Instagram in this finale or this reunion four different times. Who’s here for fame?” she said on the podcast, referring to <a href=#>Zack’s revelation that he had shared “receipts”</a> for fans to view via social media. “You’re the one making all these videos, doing all this stuff. [Irina]’s been on ghost mode for weeks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Love-Is-Blinds-Micah-Reacts-to-Zack-Goytowski-Fame-Comments.jpg><p>The former Bachelor, 42, joked, “I don’t know if anyone on this show can really make that accusation [about fame] without having the finger pointed back at them. You’re all on a TV show.”</p><p>Micah agreed, adding, “There are other ways to find love. … Be real with yourself. Maybe [fame’s] not why you came, but you’re making it work.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Micah ended the season single — <a href=#>she was rejected by fiancé <strong>Paul Peden</strong> at the altar</a> — she still gained a friend in Irina. The women were <a href=#>called out online for their “mean girl” attitudes</a> as the episodes aired, but they each recognize their faults.</p><p>“I think [Irina] was really hurt by the fact that she hurt people,” Micah said. “And I agree with her, I felt the same way. I think there was a lot that was misunderstood and not seen. … What I can take accountability for is being immature and being selfish.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVitrR5waWgp5yjYrqqr8ChZKykkaLAbsbAnKJmn5%2BuwbDD0qSgZp6RorJur86mpJ6mpKh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
