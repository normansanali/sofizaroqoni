Involved in a years-long feud with Yungeen Ace and the rapper's crew, Foolio is well-known for his numerous diss records against the ATK representative, regularly dissing Ace's deceased friends and family members.</p><p>During a recent interview on <a href=# rel>DJ Akademiks' Off The Record podcast</a>, Foolio spoke about his feud with Yungeen Ace and&nbsp;<a href=# rel>last year's release of the viral video for "Who I Smoke,"</a> which takes aim at him. He also touched on a <a href=# rel>shooting incident that happened last year</a>, which resulted in him nearly losing his life.'</p><p>Recalling everything that happened before an assassination attempt was made on his life, Foolio told Ak, "I walk out of the studio, I'm walking to my car. Anytime I walk anywhere, I got my gun in my hand, walking wherever in Jacksonville, that's just how you gotta be," said Foolio. "As soon as I get to sit down a little bit, n***as get to blowin', pop, pop, pop, pop. I just see two n***as shootin'. I had located where the shots were comin' from, like, 'What the f*ck going on!? I'm dead, I know I'm dead.' These n***as blowin'. So I leaned back, upped my gun and get to shootin' back. I shoot my whole clip and sh*t. Them n***as dropped they clip at the scene, all type of sh*t. I thought I popped one of them b*tch ass n***as. I saw the car pull off. When I hopped out the car, I had one slide on and I'm running back up to the studio. I run up to the studio like, 'Boy, you set me up!' He's like, 'Hell nah!' He showed me his messages, like, 'I swear to God, on my mom!'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/80/26/982680_1e40d8c40e6019d9c4595743061747e6.png><p>Foolio went on to state that he had three guns with him at the time of the shooting-- two on his person and another in the trunk of the car.&nbsp;</p><p>During the same interview, Foolio also spoke about his diss track back-and-forth with Yungeen Ace, explaining how he felt after "Who I Smoke" dropped and&nbsp;<a href=# rel>before he released "When I See You."</a></p><p>"I ain't no hater, the song went crazy!" he said about Spinabenz and Yungeen Ace's viral hit. "I'm mad as f*ck. That was going crazy! I was like, 'Damn, what can I do?' I go to Miami, I was already going through my comments and they were hitting me with a bunch of songs to remix. They sent <a href=# class=text-word rel>Miley Cyrus</a> 'Party In The USA,' imagine me rapping on that sh*t! They said Michael Jackson 'Beat It'. They sent all types of sh*t but what stood out to me was 'When I See You' [by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Fantasia</a>]. Did that song, I first listened to it in the studio like, 'Damn, these n***as finna be mad.' So I get back to Jacksonville, I go get a poster printed out of the news clip with [Ace's] dead homeboys on the sh*t, I get two bottles of cheap ass champagne, I go to the graveyard, I shoot the video, I dropped that b*tch."</p><p>Answering whether he thinks he went too far, Foolio said, "Hell nah. Once dead people get mentioned, it's already too far."</p><p>Watch a few clips from Foolio's interview with DJ Akademiks below, as well as the two diss tracks mentioned.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZYZ2fZZmnainnJ68br7EnJilpKNirrS%2FwKyqoqaRqbawuoyaq62dnaXBbr%2FAsqpmsaWjtKaxzWaYnJ2jYsSpu4yiZKyln6CybsPEp6tmm6KWx7p5zZ6urA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
