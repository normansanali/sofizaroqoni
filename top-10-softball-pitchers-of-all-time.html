These pitchers have demonstrated their excellence and drive and are considered the best softball pitchers in history. In the profiles down below, we take an in-depth look at the ten best softball pitchers of all time, where they retired with on their statistical leaderboards, what awards each one garnered during and after her career, and much more.</p><h2 data-id=f141aefe-12e5-44fe-a1e6-1b9fe2518a9a data-mce-fragment=1>1. Cat Osterman</h2><p data-id=40b66f63-de96-46d0-9238-40781159750a data-mce-fragment=1>Cat Osterman is, without a doubt, one of the greatest pitchers to ever play. A three-time National Player of the Year and back-to-back Honda Award winner, Osterman cast an incredible shadow over Texas softball before moving on as a star pitcher with the U.S. football team. Her career numbers include 2,265 strikeouts, a record that has the biggest strikeout work game average in NCAA history. What Osterman has done for the game is unquestionable, and she is one of those players that legends are made from in softball.</p><h2 data-id=bf93ae25-9921-4188-86b0-49b4fea915fd data-mce-fragment=1>2. Monica Abbott</h2><p data-id=2f5cc8da-2bec-4b51-8cd6-563162319f57 data-mce-fragment=1>Monica Abbott, the all-time leader in NCAA strikeouts with 2,440, owner of a single-season strikeout record (724), and no-hitter streak that lasted more than a month last season, is one of the best pitchers ever. Winning another NCAA title and numerous other shutouts add to the incredible resume she has built on her career.</p><h2 data-id=fff31354-33f5-4969-b2f8-ab38b7e7bf68 data-mce-fragment=1>3. Jennie Finch</h2><p data-id=9aa8a33f-fb2b-4fa8-a407-0286f88619b1 data-mce-fragment=1>One of the biggest names and maybe most dominant softball players in history is Jennie Finch. She went a perfect 32-0 during her NCAA season with the Arizona Wildcats (2001), snatching the national championship along the way. Honda awards and the distinction of having a program record for winning percentage (55.2 %)and most consecutive wins prove her impact on women's baseball, especially at Oregon.</p><h2 data-id=baa6e21c-7936-4e53-9dc7-6310a34c574c data-mce-fragment=1>4. Nancy Evans</h2><p data-id=6cbbcd7f-60d6-4be2-a450-e95dc344d55a data-mce-fragment=1>There is nothing like Nancy Evans' three national championships and 124-8 career pitching record (. 98 ERA), which further cement her legacy as one of the greatest pitchers ever to take a circle in NCAA softball history.</p><h2 data-id=13058c1d-98b1-42d1-b7f4-abdbcfca7f8f data-mce-fragment=1>5. Lisa Fernandez</h2><p data-id=d2929bad-61a8-4a51-9924-0248864835ee data-mce-fragment=1>Softball was dominated by Lisa Fernandez, who won the Honda award on all four occasions she played at UCLA and finished with a career .22 ERA. She was awarded the Honda Broderick Cup, an award given to the best female college athlete in any sport and is considered one of her sports greatest icons for how dominant she was on that field.</p><h2 data-id=15b91ef0-5156-4f26-88f0-ca2a1129af3f data-mce-fragment=1>6. Michele Granger</h2><p data-id=ee300a5b-938e-4310-8a3f-83fd67a960c0 data-mce-fragment=1>Being a pitcher, she certainly threw her fair share of no-hitters—25 over her career, in fact, which is the NCAA record—and tallied up an all-time best when she finished playing softball, with 1640 total strikeouts.</p><h2 data-id=d52b9e59-5f51-466d-8136-e2bfe52d68cd data-mce-fragment=1>7. Danielle Lawrie</h2><p data-id=7068a3b4-c8ac-46cb-8e55-a2b8c1a0c180 data-mce-fragment=1>The NCAA's leader in Ks remains Danielle Lawrie, who finished her career at Washington with 1860 strikeouts and a national championship. Strong campaigns, back-to-back USA Softball Player of the Year awards, and two Honda are also part of a robust career line.</p><h2 data-id=92515c4d-09e3-4459-8e63-6bbf9690be42 data-mce-fragment=1>8. Courtney Blades</h2><p data-id=23749a3c-8284-4f3c-acc5-400df6534b45 data-mce-fragment=1>The success of Southern Miss in the WCWS, combined with Courtneys shattering the NCAA Division I career strikeout record and an NCAA record 52 wins, certainly secures her spot as one of the game's best.</p><h2 data-id=be9cab95-e6ae-45f5-b245-3542486efce2 data-mce-fragment=1>9. Keilani Ricketts</h2><p data-id=3cfc3191-48f8-4fff-9626-7e95fadfa973 data-mce-fragment=1>Keilani Ricketts' back-to-back National Player of the Year accolades and Honda Awards, followed by winning the 2013 Broderick Cup, denotes her as one of, if not the best, softball players in history.</p><h2 data-id=11b2a8e1-81b8-4834-850e-a5b760f2dcf4 data-mce-fragment=1>10. Rachel Garcia</h2><p data-id=98c83946-9dda-4b82-9f4a-2f652f2a2708 data-mce-fragment=1>Rachel Garcia elevates her status as one of NCAA softball's best pitchers after leading UCLA to a national title last year and consecutive Honda Awards.</p><p>These greats have represented and played the game of softball better than many others in history. The lofty career achievements, numbers, and presence they brought to the game have them sitting as the best softball pitchers ever. Belting home runs, snaring ground balls, or tossing no-hitters, these standouts have staked their claim in softball forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mikpZpfqbyxeZBpZKynlqmvorjLZqeirJOdsrO%2FjKidZpmcoXq1tcye</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
