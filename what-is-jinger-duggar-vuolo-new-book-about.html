But once the Duggar kids grew up, got married, and moved out of Jim Bob and Michelle's family compound, things got even more interesting. For one thing, some of the Duggar kids didn't exactly follow in their parents' strict, conservative footsteps. Simple things like <a href=#>Jinger's cutting her hair short</a> or <a href=#>Duggar wife Anna wearing pants</a> made headlines and got fans thinking that Jim Bob and Michelle's influence over their now-grown kids had finally faded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Jinger Dugger Vuolo is releasing a book, and fans have even more questions about her upbringing, marriage, and life in Los Angeles with her husband Jeremy Vuolo.</p><h2 id=jinger-duggar-vuolo-knew-about-19-kids-and-counting-fans-39-opinions>Jinger Duggar Vuolo Knew About 19 Kids And Counting Fans' Opinions</h2><p>TLC fans who started watching the Duggars when Jinger was barely a teen will recall the "free Jinger" movement. Viewers picked up some vibes from Jinger early on that had them thinking she would make a break from the conventional Duggar household sooner rather than later.</p><p>When Jinger began courting Jeremy Vuolo, a former soccer player turned pastor, many fans crossed their fingers and hoped Jinger would break free of her parents and the heavy responsibilities at home with so many younger siblings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Jinger Duggar And Jeremy Vuolo's Relationship Timeline">Jinger Duggar And Jeremy Vuolo's Relationship Timeline</a></span></p><p>She <a href=#>has made some not-so-Duggar life choices and spoken out about them</a>, but Jinger has also made it clear that she's heard the fan theories about her.</p><p>Fans on Reddit discussed that Jinger's sisters had, at one point, confirmed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the "free Jinger" movement was something she was aware of</a>. That led to a theory that Jinger's new tell-all book was both a dig at critics as well as inspired by them.</p><h2 id=is-jinger-39-s-new-book-title-inspired-by-criticisms-of-the-duggar-family>Is Jinger's New Book Title Inspired By Criticisms Of The Duggar Family?</h2><p>In the Reddit post where Duggar followers (perhaps not quite fans) discussed Jinger's book, the top comment suggested the post was a "s*** post" with "top tier snarking well done." That's because the title of Jinger Vuolo's book is apparently Becoming Free Indeed: My Story of Disentangling Faith from Fear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many commenters immediately assumed Jinger had titled her book as such because of the free Jinger movement, turning the phrase back around on critics to reframe her experience in a way that feels authentic to her.</p><p>Not everyone agreed with the trolling theory, though. Commenters pointed out that "free indeed" also has a religious intonation, which would make more sense given Jinger's upbringing and background, and her husband's gig as a pastor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it could be both, as some commenters pointed out. Either way, the book (which hasn't been released as of this article's publication) has already stirred up interest. But most Redditors agreed that the book probably won't be the gossipy tell-all that they're hoping for.</p><h2 id=what-is-jinger-vuolo-39-s-new-book-about>What Is Jinger Vuolo's New Book About?</h2><p>Though the title of Jinger's new book speaks for itself, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">would-be readers are conflicted about what it really means</a>. The consensus is that Jinger will talk about her faith in the context of how her beliefs as a younger person are different from her beliefs as an adult.</p><p>Yet commenters aren't sure she'll go as far as to say that her parents guided her the wrong way in terms of religion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One commenter posited, "It'll be a very mild disagreement at best," suggesting that Jinger won't throw her parents under the bus, but that she does seem to want to capitalize on the hint of controversy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Jinger Vuolo Struggled With Her Strict Religious Upbringing: 'I Hated It'">Jinger Vuolo Struggled With Her Strict Religious Upbringing: 'I Hated It'</a></span></p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">book's description</a> does give a smidge more insight, however, noting, in part; "Jinger, along with three of her sisters, wrote a New York Times bestseller about their religious convictions. She believed this level of commitment would guarantee God's blessing, even though in private she felt constant fear that she wasn't measuring up to the high standards demanded of her."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Much Money Did The Duggars Make During Their Decade-Plus Reality TV Run?">How Much Money Did The Duggars Make During Their Decade-Plus Reality TV Run?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The description concludes, "Now with a renewed faith of personal conviction, Becoming Free Indeed shares what it was like living under the tenants of Bill Gothard, the Biblical truth that changed her perspective, and how she disentangled her faith with her belief in Jesus intact."</p><p>Fans (and critics) will just have to wait and see what the full book reveals, if anything. Jinger's book Becoming Free Indeed: My Story of Disentangling Faith from Fear is set to release in January 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecmipaCdomKxtrPGmqlmrqWkubB5zZ6uZpqfpLhurcGorK1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
