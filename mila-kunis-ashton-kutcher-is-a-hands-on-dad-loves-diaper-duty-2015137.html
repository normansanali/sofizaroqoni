Dirty diapers are no match for first-time dad <strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong>, who welcomed daughter Wyatt Isabelle with wife <strong>Mila Kunis</strong> last October. Speaking about their daughter in an interview with the UK's <a href=#>Telegraph</a> recently, Kunis raved about her hubby's parenting prowess.</p><p>"My husband is an incredibly hands-on dad," the Jupiter Ascending actress, 31, told the paper of the Two and a Half Men alum, 37. "When my child was born, I was breast-feeding and he said, 'That's your connection, I want to change every diaper.'"&nbsp;</p><p>Kutcher wasn't kidding. In fact, he <a href=#>made a Facebook plea</a> back in March for diaper-changing stations in men's restrooms.&nbsp;</p><p>"When we're in public, if it's a pee-pee diaper you can change her at the table, but if it's a poo-poo diaper you don't want to affect the people eating," Kunis explained to The&nbsp;Telegraph. "So he's like, 'Err, I guess I'm going to the ladies' room to do it.'"</p><p>Gender-neutral changing facilities are just one of the many issues on the couple's agenda. Both self-proclaimed Democrats, the former That '70s Show costars are committed to raising their social and political consciousness, especially now that they have a child.</p><p>"I would love her to have a woman [in the White House]," Kunis said of the upcoming election, "to think, 'If there's a woman president, what is there that I can't do?'"&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the meantime, though, the Ted actress has less weighty plans for her little one. "For Halloween, we do family outfits," she shared. "It makes everyone go crazy…Last year I dressed [my daughter] as a pig. I went as a pig. And my husband went as a pig."&nbsp;</p><p>As previously reported, Kunis and Kutcher <a href=#>exchanged vows</a> over the July 4 holiday weekend, but <a href=#>were legally married</a> well before their hush-hush wedding. After the Oak Glen, Calif., nuptials, they embarked on <a href=#>their honeymoon in Yosemite</a> National Park — a perfect trip for the low-maintenance travelers.</p><p>"My husband and I always backpack through Europe," Kunis told The Telegraph. "We were in Belgium recently, and we thought, 'Let's go straight to the airport and get on a flight to Spain.' We can just pick up and go."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamoZyWeqzBzaKqZpmjncGwuoykrK2bmJq%2FbrXSZphmoJGjsbR5zqdknZmUYrmwwsSsZJ2hkaWys3nDrquyZWJlfnZ9knBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
