It is unclear if this tweet is referring to her previous tweets about being diagnosed with bipolar disorder or if she is referring to other tweets from Monday night that have since been deleted.</p><p><strong>Original story:</strong> For the first time since being released from her treatment facility in Pasadena, Calif. last week, <strong><a href=#>Amanda Bynes</a></strong> has spoken out. The former Nickelodeon star, 28, tweeted a series of apparent explanations on her official page in the early morning hours of Tuesday, Nov. 4.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was diagnosed bi – polar and manic depressive so I'm on medication and I'm seeing my psychologist and pyshchiatrist weekly so I'm fine :D,” she <a href=#>wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And though she claims to have sorted out her medical issues, Bynes still appears to be struggling with her parents and current conservators, <strong>Rick Bynes</strong> and <strong>Lynn Organ</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I need to get an apartment and my parents won't give me access to any of my funds,” she <a href=#>tweeted</a>. “I'm not living with my parents. I'm not legally obligated to. My lawyer said if I comply with the courts and take my meds and see my psychologist and pyshchiatrist weekly then I will get unconserved. Thank GOD.”&nbsp;</p><p>In mid-October, the Easy A star <a href=#>accused her father of sexually abusing</a> her on Twitter. After her mother released a statement bashing the allegations, Bynes then retracted her claims, tweeting, “My dad never did any of those things The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZGjsaJ5wbKlnqtdqcSmsdOsZJ2hkZy7sL%2FEnWSboaCkuaK%2BjJ2grKeimbKzecWipZ5lYmV%2BdYCQamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
