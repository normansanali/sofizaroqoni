But fewer have heard of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Alaska Triangle</a>, despite the alarming statistic that more than 20,000 people have disappeared there.</p><p>Most first became aware of the Alaska Triangle in October 1972, when a twin-engine Cessna 310 plane carrying U.S. House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, Representative Nick Begich, one of Begich’s aides, Russell Brown, and the plane’s pilot, Don Jonz, vanished between Anchorage and Juneau.</p><p>Despite a massive search, the plane was never found. Some suspected that Boggs had been deliberately killed because while on the Warren Commission — set up by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate John F. Kennedy’s assassination — Boggs had dissented from his peers and suggested that Kennedy was not killed by a lone assassin. But Boggs was just one of many thousands of people to disappear in the Alaskan wilderness.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-450025 alt="Hale Boggs" width=800 height=999 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/hale-boggs.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-450025 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Hale Boggs is only one person who’s disappeared within the Alaska Triangle, one of the scariest places on Earth.</span></p><p>In fact, <a href=# rel=noopener>HISTORY</a> reports that some 20,000 people have disappeared across the Alaska Triangle in the past 50 years. Other planes have vanished, as have hikers, tourists, and locals. So what has happened to all these people?</p><p>No one knows for sure, though some have chalked up the thousands of disappearances to the brutal terrain. The Alaska Triangle covers a broad stretch of wilderness where people have to contend with year-round snowfall, dense woods, and hidden caves. There, it’s easy for people who don’t know the land —&nbsp;and even for those who do —&nbsp;to disappear.</p><p>Then again, there could be another explanation. There have been alleged encounters with UFOs in the airspace over the Alaska Triangle. And some even believe that the disappearances could be paranormal in nature, perhaps relating to terrifying creatures described in Native American folklore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0r8CroJ6rpGK9ra3Cnqpmp55isqK%2B06Fmbw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
