The whole thing was ablaze and it was too hot to touch. There was an inferno in the room.”</p><p>Eventually, she was able to get it under control when she threw it out the front door. “It could have burned the place down,” Thompson said. “It was scary at the time, but funny looking back that Gwyneth’s vagina candle exploded in my living room.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gwyneth-Paltrow-Vagina-Candle-Exploded-In-Someone-Living-Room-Inline.jpg><p>A Goop spokesperson tells Us that “the candle was not purchased through the outlet, so we aren’t able to verify its authenticity.”</p><p>“We’re in touch with the woman to see if she followed the specific fire safety instructions included with the candle, such as trimming the wick and not burning it for more than two hours,” a full statement given to Us reads. “At goop, we vet the products we sell and make customer safety a priority, so we’ve alerted the manufacturer to the woman’s issue and have also reached out to her to send her some goop products to help pass the days in quarantine.”</p><p>Paltrow’s “Vagina” candle made headlines when it dropped back in January 2020, selling out almost immediately. The <a href=# rel=noopener>$75 burner</a> is made with notes of geranium, citrusy bergamot, cedar absolutes, Damask rose and ambrette seed. The result is a “funny, gorgeous, sexy, and beautifully unexpected” scent, per the Goop website.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Oscar</a> winner told Us Weekly’s Stylish the idea to market it around the smell of a vagina was a feminist push. “You grew up getting messaging around the feminine care that was heavily scented with synthetic fragrances and all this kind of thing,” the actress <a href=# rel=noopener>told Us exclusively</a> while promoting her new partnership with <a href=# rel=noopener>Xeomin</a>. “I just felt it was time to make a bit of a feminist statement around accepting who we are and our femininity.”</p><p>However, the whole thing originally started off as witty banter. “So, it sort of started as a joke,” she said on <a href=# rel=noopener>Late Night With Seth Meyers</a> in January 2020. “I was with the nose Douglas Little for his brand Heretic and we were kind of messing around and I smelled this beautiful thing, and I was like, ‘That smells like my vagina.’ And I was kidding, obviously.”</p><p>She told Us it then became something she’s really proud of. “I feel like once people get past the initial shock of it, and you really start to unpack what it means and what it’s saying, it’s pretty cool.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5zEurrErZ9mqJGhwbO71qxkoKefpXq1tMisZKyllaG5tHnLoqKeZZ2ueretxqKlmmWTlruluMRmnLGonKSxprCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
