We encourage you all to discuss Anthony’s thoughts in the comments section at the bottom of this post and follow him on Twitter <a href=#>@ToeKneeManGo</a>.</p><p class=p4><span class=s2>Ever since the build to <a href=#>WrestleMania</a> 34, the narrative for <a href=#>Roman Reigns</a> has been that “management doesn’t want him to win the title.”</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s2>Week after week for the past few months, there have been either subtle remarks along these lines, or Reigns has cut a promo specifically beating us over the head with this idea that somehow, the powers that be in WWE are actually against him being the champion.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s2>Clearly, the story the creative team wants to try to tell is that he’s the next <a href=#>Daniel Bryan</a>—someone who the fans should get behind as an underdog and really crave to see succeed, but by golly, he just keeps getting screwed out of it. Woe is us. Let’s tune in next week to see if he gets what he deserves.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s2>It isn’t working. It hasn’t worked at all during this <a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> build, for even one week, and it isn’t going to work, no matter how many weeks WWE tries this.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s2>Roman Reigns is not Daniel Bryan, in so many ways, and the sooner WWE realizes that, the better.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s2>In fact, the differences are so numerous that it is astonishing this is even a story that’s being attempted, as everybody in the world can see the flaws.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s2>Bryan was a revered wrestler on the indie scene. Reigns is very much a byproduct of the WWE machine and a homegrown talent—not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it’s just a great starting point to illustrate how shaky this angle’s foundation is.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s2>Bryan Danielson had developed a reputation as someone people wanted to see in WWE and wasn’t getting the right opportunities. He came into <a href=#>NXT</a> and was eliminated in the first go-around for being humble, not for sucking. He then was legitimately fired from WWE for doing his job too well during the Nexus angle.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s2>Following that, he was rehired and went through a mid-card phase and had to work his way up to the top, but he was destroyed in record time for the opening of WrestleMania 28 by a company-pushed guy, <a href=#>Sheamus</a>, and had to work his way back up to the top AGAIN after that, being passed over in favor of <a href=#>Batista</a>.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s2>When he finally ascended the throne, fans had been clamoring for it for years and the trigger was finally pulled, but with Reigns, it’s the complete opposite.</span></p><p>Next Page:&nbsp;Roman Reigns Isn’t Daniel Bryan & Never Will Be (cont.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwhZRsam5vXae8rq3NZqmeoZejwG610qerZpyRo7amuIybqbKZnmK7psLEq2SwoZyheqOx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
