On Thursday (March 28), the Atlanta-born entertainer posted a photo dump on Instagram revealing how she spent her big day with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her beau, DDG</a>, and their baby boy, Halo. It's unclear exactly where Bailey and her family are soaking up so much sunshine, but the smiles on their faces prove their making unforgettable memories there.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"This is 24 ü•∞üéâüíòüéÇ," the birthday girl wrote in her caption, selecting a mud-covered picture of her and her infant to begin. Though we can see his full head of hair, Halo's face remains a mystery as his parents <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">protect his privacy</a>. For someone who only gave birth a few months ago, Bailey's body looks banging in her purple bikini, and she appears more confident than ever before. "My Halle and Halo üòçüòçüòç," the "Angel" singer's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">big sister, Chloe,</a> wrote in the comments.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-halle-bailey-and-baby-halo-enjoy-the-outdoors-together>Halle Bailey and Baby Halo Enjoy the Outdoors Together</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On the third slide, we get a glimpse of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DDG</a>'s back, which has "Halo's Daddy" written on it in mud. Speaking of the Michigan native, he made sure to keep Bailey looking fresh with a luxurious new gift ‚Äì a Rolex watch ‚Äì on her big day.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ddg-keeps-his-other-half-looking-fly-with-a-luxurious-gift>DDG Keeps His Other Half Looking Fly with a Luxurious Gift</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Oddly enough, it was only a year ago when social media sleuths were speculating about a breakup between Halle Bailey and DDG. Not long before The Little Mermaid premiere, gossip about him and Rubi Rose <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">rekindling their old flame</a> lit up the internet, but obviously there wasn't much truth to that. Do you think Halo's parents are in an end game relationship?
