If you’ve been keeping up with the news in recent weeks, you’ll remember that a pre-teen was shot twice for knocking on the wrong door during the same week when a woman was shot and killed for pulling into the wrong driveway — and two teenagers were shot when one tried to get into the wrong car after cheer practice.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>We bring these situations up to remind anyone who needs it that we’re all human, and mistakes happen — and they certainly shouldn’t get innocent people shot or, worse, killed. So when meteorologist Chris Robbins shared a story about a child ringing his doorbell alongside the notion that he had a loaded gun waiting for her, his followers were shocked.</p><p>“A child just rang my doorbell. Folks you do NOT ring doorbells in 2023. My 6 was loaded. Keep your kids away.”</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>While that statement alone was jarring enough, Robbins continued setting sail in a boat with no paddle as he said he threatened her with hair-pulling if she were to ever return to his home. No, we’re not making this up.</p><p>“Folks, it is a bad idea to allow your kids to go around ringing doorbells in 2023. Read the news. Stop it. If my doorbell rings again tomorrow I might pull someone’s hair lol. I’m just playing, but it really is a bad idea for kids roaming around ringing doorbells. This is not 1972. If that brat rings my doorbell again tomorrow, I will call the police. I feel bad because I warned her that I might pull her hair if they rang my door again. She started crying… Learning opportunity. She found a nice grumpy old man. Others out there will cause harm.”</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Robbins tried everything from doubling down further to fake apologies and even claims about being hacked, but none of that made a difference. There are few things more alarming in this world than knowing you live next to someone unhinged, and it’s even less fair to have to deal with as a child.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Robbins’ latest apology attempts to say he was only thinking of her safety, as he threatened to pull her hair and took to social media to remind his followers that he had a loaded gun — so that makes sense.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>No amount of apologies has changed the fact that there are very few people on Robbins’ side, even after his latest apology that now says the entire situation happened because he was in a “bad mood.” When we’re in a bad mood, we rewatch&nbsp;One Tree Hill; we don’t startle children, but we digress. He also could have helped her find her cat and then maybe had a chat with her parents, but we’ll digress on that one, too.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=164 data-injectable=false>The American Meteorological Society took to social media to share that Robbins hasn’t been a member since 2018, despite his website claiming that he is.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>AMS thanks those who brought our attention by tweeting us today.</p><p>Chris Robbins has not been an AMS member since 2018; however, we want to clarify that we do not condone violence of any kind.
