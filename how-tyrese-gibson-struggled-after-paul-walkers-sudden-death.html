The "Baby Boy" actor visited the crash site where Walker died, the day after the accident and proceeded to break down into tears as he was overcome with emotion. Gibson also poured his heart out online once he learned of his "Fast and Furious" co-star's death. "My heart is hurting so bad no one can make me believe this is real," he wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> in 2013 alongside a photo of the two on set together. The following day, Gibson uploaded to <a href=#>Instagram</a> the "last exchange" the two shared via text, as the "Four Brothers" actor wished Walker a happy Thanksgiving.</p><p dir=ltr>Walker's death occurred before filming on 'Furious 7' had finished, and the crew had the unenviable task of continuing without the franchise's star. "The first thing all of us were struggling with was, 'What the hell are we doing here? What's "Fast and Furious" without Paul?'" Gibson recalled to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2021. The shared tragedy allowed the remaining cast members to band together. "So we had to become each other's therapists," he added.</p><p dir=ltr>Although the cast and crew were able to finish production on "Furious 7," and the film was a hit, it was far from a triumphant moment for Gibson. "Once 'Furious 7' came out, it was hard to watch. So I definitely don't have that one on repeat," he told Entertainment Weekly. Years later, Gibson still mourned Walker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampgZ353g46hprBlpK6%2Fpr%2FEZp6imqOku26%2F06usoJ%2BcmrFurcWtnKtloJbCrXnWmqOknaKoerTBw52cp2WUmq61tI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
