She was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was later pronounced dead.</p><p>The motorcycle operator, Daniel Glover, 44, of Easton, was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said.</p><p>Police said&nbsp;preliminary investigation suggests the motorcycle entered the rotary&nbsp;in the wrong direction and collided with another vehicle.</p><p>DeForitis served with the Seekonk Police Department for just under three years after attending the Cape Cod Municipal Police Academy in 2021.</p><p>“Since that time, she has been assigned to the Patrol Division and was outstanding in her various roles as a community outreach officer. Kourtny had a particular fondness for the youth of Seekonk and could be found playfully interacting with them in the schools and at community events, usually with a bright smile on her face and a contagious laugh,” the Seekonk Police Department posted on social media.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
