But in 2014, he revealed he had been suffering from debilitating bouts of depression for years, and he was afraid to seek help. "Having a bad day is one thing, having a bad week is another, having a bad life ... You don't want to move, you can't move in the darkness," he explained to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. Brady said he continued to wallow in his misery and self-pity.</p><p dir=ltr>"This is what I deserve, so I am going to sit here because I am that horrible of a person," he continued. The "How I Met Your Mother" actor's 42nd birthday was a real low point. "I was there by myself, in my bedroom and I had a complete breakdown," he said. Speaking to <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a> in 2019, Brady said he shared his story after <a href=#>Robin Williams' tragic death by suicide</a> in 2014. "I thought that if someone who brings so much joy has the problem of loving themselves, then I can't ignore it."</p><p dir=ltr>Brady noted that his ex-wife, Mandie Taketa helped him get to a better place. "She was down with me when nobody in the world was down with me, except my mom," he told ET. In 2015, he filmed a PSA for <a href=#>Bring Change 2 Mind</a>, an organization devoted to eliminating the stigma around mental health issues, per <a href=#>People</a>. "I really wish that I would have spoken out earlier," he says in the TV spot.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know needs help with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the <a href=#>National Institute of Mental Health website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlgbIVyhY6wmLKmlWKvs63DsmSfqp%2BieqS7zJ6bsmWkpHqjvs6am7CZqWKur7CMm5yyp56ZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
