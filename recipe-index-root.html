I hadn’t until just recently, instead reaching for veggies like sweet corn, mushrooms, and zucchini whenever I fired up the grill. But a few weeks ago, I brought a bag of bright red romas home from the market. A variety of paste tomatoes, they’re firmer and denser than the heirloom tomatoes that I like to add to salads at this time of year. So, on a night when I was grilling veggie burgers for dinner, I decided to try grilling the tomatoes too. Seriously, I had no idea what I was missing! Grilled tomatoes are…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>As I write this, I’m just finishing up one of these blueberry muffins, and I’m savoring every bite. It’s moist, fluffy, and packed with juicy berries, with warm depth of flavor from vanilla and cinnamon. It’s not overly sweet and cake-y, like some blueberry muffins tend to be. Instead, it’s lightly sweet and satisfying – perfect for breakfast or a healthy snack. I first shared this healthy blueberry muffin recipe a few years ago, but I thought I’d bring it back this summer. It’s one of my favorites on the blog, and it is blueberry season, after all! If you’re…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This double chocolate zucchini bread is moist, fudgy, and delicious. In the summertime, it’s my favorite way to satisfy a chocolate craving. It tastes just as decadent as a rich chocolate cake, but it’s made with healthier ingredients like whole wheat flour, maple syrup, and zucchini. Eating your vegetables has never tasted so good! Like my classic zucchini bread recipe, this recipe makes two loaves. They disappear pretty quickly in our house, but if you have extra, pop one loaf in the freezer for another day, or share it with a friend! They (and you) will love this chocolate zucchini…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>By popular request: air fryer fried pickles! Recently, a few of you have asked me if I’ve made fried pickles in the air fryer. After getting the question a couple of times, I knew I had to try it. I have to say, I’m so glad I did! These air fryer fried pickles are crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle, salty, tangy, and completely addictive. They’re a great fun, easy appetizer for a summer happy hour, though honestly, we like these air fryer pickles so much that I plan to make them at all times of year. I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Creamy and tangy, with a delicious spicy kick, this remoulade is my favorite sauce of the moment. I’ve been slathering it on veggie burgers, serving it with French fries, and setting it out with these addictive air fryer fried pickles. We even loved it on the grilled sweet potatoes we made last week! All that’s to say, if you’re looking for an easy sauce to punch up a meal, this remoulade might be just the thing. Classic French remoulade resembles tartar sauce. It has a mayonnaise base, and capers or gherkins and fresh herbs are often mixed in.

In our corner of the Midwest, blueberry season has just begun. We’re enjoying these bursty, sweet-tart fruits in as many ways as we can. Fresh, in muffins, simmered into a syrupy compote… But when we’re in the mood for a real treat, I make this blueberry cobbler. I really love this recipe because it puts the fresh fruit front and center. I only sweeten it lightly, letting the berries’ natural sweetness shine, and I skew heavy on the ratio of fruit to biscuit topping. This blueberry cobbler recipe features a thin layer…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you love a cute, colorful veggie as much as I do, head to the farmers market and buy yourself a box of patty pan squash. These adorable summer squash tend to be small in size, and their shape varies. Some are round, others are tulip-shaped, and still others look like little flying saucers with fun scalloped edges. You’ll find them in a variety of colors – dark green, light green, yellow, or a mix – but they all have a similar texture and taste. Their flavor is close to that of yellow squash, but they have firmer, denser flesh.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s official: I can’t make it through a summer without sharing a new panzanella recipe. To me, this Italian bread salad is the perfect template for turning whatever produce I happen to have on hand into a fresh-yet-satisfying meal. Sweet corn? Peaches? Peppers? Yep, I’ve panzanella-ed them all. Of course, traditionally, panzanella isn’t an any-vegetable-goes kind of salad. It originated in Tuscany as a way to use up stale bread, and tomatoes were always a key ingredient. Their juices soak into the bread, softening it and giving it flavor. Onions, basil, and a tangy vinaigrette round out the dish.

To be honest, I was surprised. This pesto pizza recipe doesn’t call for any fancy ingredients or special techniques. It’s simple and classic, a delicious reminder of how flavorful seasonal ingredients, like summer tomatoes and garden-fresh basil, can be. If you find yourself with this summer bounty on hand in the next few weeks, I really hope you’ll try this pesto pizza. It’s so much more than the sum of its parts.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This easy vegan coleslaw is the perfect side dish for a summer cookout, picnic, or BBQ. It tastes just like classic coleslaw, but the ingredients all happen to be 100% plant-based. A creamy, sweet, and tangy dressing coats crunchy cabbage, carrots, and scallions. Set it out at your next gathering with whatever you’re grilling, and I promise, it’ll be a hit! No one will guess that this coleslaw is vegan.

Until I started making this ice cream cake recipe, every slice of ice cream cake I’d ever eaten was the same. I’m sure you know the kind. It has layers of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, cookie crumbles, and hot fudge, with swooshes of whipped cream frosting decorating the outside. I’ll admit that the combination is delicious, but when I started working on this ice cream cake recipe, I wanted to do something different.
