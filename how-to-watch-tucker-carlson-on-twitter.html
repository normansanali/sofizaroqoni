He began by criticizing the news industry, which he claimed is incapable of telling the truth.</p><p>"Speech is the fundamental prerequisite for democracy. That's why it was enshrined in the first of our Constitutional amendments," he said. "Amazingly, as of tonight, there are not that many platforms left that allow free speech. The last big one remaining in the world — the only one — is Twitter."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We’re back. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sG5t9gr60O</a></p>— Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) <a href=#>May 9, 2023</a></figure><p>He added, "Twitter has long served as the place where our national conversation incubates and develops. Twitter is not a partisan site. Everybody's allowed here, and we think that's a good thing."</p><p>Tucker offered little to no explanation for what his new show may entail, simply stating that he'll be bringing a "new version of the show we’ve been doing for the last six and a half years to Twitter." He noted that "free speech" would be an important part of the show, calling it "the main right you have."</p><p>The right-wing pundit has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">yet to sign a deal</a> with Twitter owner Elon Musk, and it's currently unknown how people can tune in to the show. But if we had to guess, Tucker’s show will likely be available to watch via his Twitter page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZLCZpJi1bsDUnKKeql2YrrO40qilZqeeYsG4tdOtnKs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
