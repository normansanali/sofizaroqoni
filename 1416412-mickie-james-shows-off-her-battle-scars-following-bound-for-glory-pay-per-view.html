She has competed in two of the biggest wrestling promotions in the world. James revolutionalized women’s wrestling in WWE and also helped build the women’s division of IMPACT Wrestling.</p><p>James is a six-time WWE Women’s Champion. When it comes to the Nashville-based promotion, the former WWE Superstar has captured the IMPACT Wrestling Knockouts Championship an astounding five times.</p><p>At this year’s Bound For Glory pay-per-view, Mickie James attempted to capture the title for a sixth time. She challenged Trinity for the title After wrestling each other for more than ten minutes, Trinity managed to retain her title by <a href=#>forcing the wrestling legend to tap out</a>.</p><p>Prior to the match, even was a mere possibility, both stars shared their interest in wrestling each other. Trinity <a href=#>mentioned</a> that wrestling James was her dream match. James on the other hand also <a href=#>claimed</a> that it would be a money match during an interview with Wrestling News.co.</p><p>“We’ve never even had a singles match,” Mickie James said. “We’ve had tag matches, eight girl extravaganza, ten girl, different things like that, but we’ve never had a one-on-one match. We’ve been on the same team; we’ve been on opposing teams even. A lot of times, it was like we were on two different shows, so we didn’t really see each other for the pay-per-views and stuff like that, but she wants us to have a match. I want this one-on-one match too. I meant what I said,” Mickie James said.</p><p>Following the match, James shared the battle scars via a photo on social media.</p><p>“BFG ♥️ No makeup No filters No Championship No Ego Just me. ?I love you. Thank you! ?,” Mickie James <a href=#>posted</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqbW1pYmK6qq%2FKopxmopGisrR50qGmsKtdpLOneceeqWaakanBrbGMrJqaqqNis7C4y6iuoqaXYq%2Bwwc2dZJ%2BnomK0rbvRsmSpmalivaa%2BjK%2Bgnq8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
