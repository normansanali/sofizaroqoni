The official numbers revealed that Future moved 222K by the end of the streaming week. The album was largely propelled to the top through streaming, which accounts for 214K album-equivalent units. 6,500 came from pure sales while the remaining 1,500 were derived from TEA units.</p><p>It's an impressive feat for Future, who delivered the biggest week in hip-hop and R&B since <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>'s&nbsp;Certified Lover Boy moved 236K units in its second week. It also marks "the largest week for any album" since Adele's fourth studio album,&nbsp;30.&nbsp;</p><p>Future thanked the producers involved with the project after the first week sales were confirmed. "The producers who contributed to making #INEVERLIKEDYOU a success I jus wanna say THANK YOU for sharing your gift with me. Forever," he wrote on twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>Just beneath Future's new album is <a href=# class=text-word rel>The Weeknd</a>'s&nbsp;DAWN FM which leaped from #35 to #2 on the Billboard 200 this week.&nbsp;The album moved&nbsp;57K in its first week after The Weeknd released the vinyl LP, deluxe box set, and cassettes on April 29th.&nbsp;</p><p>Another notable debut on the Billboard 200 this week comes from NoCap whose debut studio album,&nbsp;Mr. Crawford debuted at #8 with 29K units.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[Via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZYZzfZJmna6spaeytHnIZqWerpWneq21yp6bZrGfqnqntdGsq2avlZq4br%2FApZysZZGnsm61zWalnq%2Bj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
