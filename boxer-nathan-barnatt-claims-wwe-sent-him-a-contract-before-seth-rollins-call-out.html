He has seen great success in many ways, especially after debuting as part of The Shield. Being such a big name, it comes as no surprise a boxer called out Rollins recently.</p><p>Over the past few years, The Visionary has undergone significant transformations. From 2019 to 2021, he was perhaps at his most despised. However, in the past year, his stock has increased by a huge margin.</p><p>Actor and boxer ‘Dad’ Nathan Barnatt competed at Creator Clash 2 in Tampa, Florida, where he defeated AB Starkilla. Following his victory, he cut a very intense and fiery promo to the crowd in attendance.</p><p>Nathan Barnatt claimed that Triple H and Vince McMahon knew him and that he received a contract from WWE two different times. He would then go on to call out Seth Rollins for a match.</p><p>“I would like to call out the entire company of the WWE. If you know me and you’ve been watching me for 20 years on YouTube then you’ll know the WWE sent me a signed contract twice. I still have that contract signed. Triple H knows me. Vince McMahon knows me. Half the roster knows me. They’ve been dancing around me for 10 years and I’m not waiting any more.</p><p>So Seth Rollins, you want to go toe to toe with a phoney YouTuber, a con artist? How about you go toe to toe with a boxer, a YouTuber from the original days, who actually wins his fights? I’ll be waiting for you at the front doors of your training facility until you answer.”</p><p>Seth Rollins defeated Logan Paul at WrestleMania 39 and he remains one of the company’s most reliable stars. Now it remains to be seen whether he will end up responding to Nathan Barnatt’s callout.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on this callout?
