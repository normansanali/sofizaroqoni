The famous rock ‘n’ roller couldn’t help but break his silence following the birth of his first child as he <a href=#>took to Instagram</a> and shared a heartwarming message for the special ladies in his life.</p><p>“My wife and daughter fill me up with so much gratitude,” the 40-year-old penned alongside a photo of <a href=#>handwritten roses</a>. “Every day, I feel so lucky. [I] just wanted to say it out loud!!! Much love and best wishes.”</p><p>Fans of the Good Charlotte frontman — who <a href=#>secretly welcomed daughter Raddix</a> with wife Cameron, 47, earlier this year — flooded his comments section with encouraging messages. “<span>You deserve nothing but the best,” one fan wrote, while another echoed, “Nothing like the love of a child.” A third fan chimed in, gushing, “I’m seriously so happy for you!”</span></p><p>Benji’s rare moment of PDA comes a few months after he and the&nbsp;<a href=#>Charlie’s Angels</a>&nbsp;star announced they officially became the proud parents of their little girl. The longtime lovebirds — who have kept their relationship extremely private ever since they tied the knot in 2015 — first shared the news of their daughter’s birth <a href=#>in a post shared in early January 2020</a>.</p><p>“Happy New Year from the Maddens! We are so happy, blessed and grateful to begin this new decade by announcing the birth of our daughter, Raddix Madden,” Cameron and Benji sweetly announced at the time. “She has instantly captured our hearts and completed our family. While we are overjoyed to share this news, we also feel a strong instinct to protect our little one’s privacy.”</p><p>Now that they’re the proud parents of their little bundle of joy, the&nbsp;Mask&nbsp;actress and her handsome husband couldn’t be more excited for this new chapter. In fact, sources revealed the doting mom and dad couldn’t wait to take on the responsibility of parenthood.</p><p>“Cameron and Benji had been trying to have a baby for a long time,” an insider told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. “There were disappointments along the way, so it was difficult and stressful at times. But they say it was a price worth paying. <a href=#>They feel beyond blessed</a>.”</p><p>We bet Cam and Benji are the most loving parents!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bnKeimWK6orDDnqVmnpWaubR5y66apLFdqbxutMCvnGabkaKys7vNZpuimapisaLBxqGrnqpdp66lsMixZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
