While some contestants prefer to be able to record and re-record, giving them the ability to perfect their audition before hitting "send", others would rather feel all the feels and take in the full experience by attending an open audition. There are 8 open call auditions to select from, and they take place in multiple cities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-is-no-cost-to-audition><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>There Is No Cost To Audition</span></h2><p>One of the best parts of auditioning for America's Got Talent lies in the fact that there is no cost to the contestant. Well, there's no cost to actually audition, that is. Any out-of-pocket expenses required to travel to the city the audition is taking place in, and any accommodations or meals required, are at the expense of each contestant.

If you're hoping to pass the audition stage but didn't quite clinch a spot on your first try, there's no need to feel disheartened. One of the perks of America's Got Talent lies in the fact that multiple attempts are permitted. However, anyone attempting their audition multiple times needs to ensure they never apply in the same city twice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-are-dress-code-rules---pay-close-attention><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>There Are Dress Code Rules - Pay Close Attention!</span></h2><p>Anyone wishing to audition for America's Got Talent should be aware that while freedom of expression is welcome and encouraged, there are a few things to bear in mind when it comes to the dress code. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Talent Recap</a> reminds contestants that bright costumes and outfits are preferred and that people generally do well when they stand out. There's one thing they don't want to see though, and that's logos.

The journey to the audition continues with a temporary placement in what's called the "holding room." This room is a busy one, and is packed with people who are nervous, excited, impatient, anxious, and also in line for their attempt to make it big. Many will use this time to practice their craft and put final touches on their performance, while others sit nervously trying to conserve their energy and compose themselves for their big chance. One thing they all have in common - they'll all be waiting in the holding room for a while!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-the-audition-room-auditions-last-less-than-2-minutes><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>In The Audition Room, Auditions Last Less Than 2 Minutes</span></h2><p>This has been quite a process so far and that's a whole lot of build up... for an audition that will last less than 2 minutes. Yes, you heard that correctly.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Talent Recap</a> reports that each audition is 90 seconds long, and reminds contestants that they "only have up to 90 seconds to show off your act, so make it count."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Facts About Julianne Hough's Time On America's Got Talent</a></span></p><h2 id=those-who-make-it-to-the-next-round-are-flown-to-southern-california><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Those Who Make It To The Next Round Are Flown To Southern California</span></h2><p>Those lucky enough to make it to the next round are lucky indeed.

As long as contestants carry the right Visa, this is open to talent from anywhere around the Globe.</p><h2 id=if-you-re-applying-repeatedly-the-entire-process-needs-to-be-started-from-scratch><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>If You're Applying Repeatedly, The Entire Process Needs To Be Started From Scratch</span></h2><p>It's amazing to be able to attempt this process as many times as you'd like. However, while there's no restriction to the number of times a contestant can try,&nbsp;there is one teeny tiny catch... they have to launch the process all over again from the very start. Those who feel they made an improvement since their last audition and are willing to try this again, can certainly do so - in a different city - and by relaunching the process from scratch!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times Simon Cowell Was Savage AF</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpp2inrCiv4ygpq1lpJa5prrTZq6hmaRixrDBjKecnpxdqbxut82ormahlmLGsMGMsJinrF2pvG6t1J2graGfo3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
