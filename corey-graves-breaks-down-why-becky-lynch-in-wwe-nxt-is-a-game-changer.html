She has been a staple of NXT the past couple of weeks and even became the NXT Women’s Champion. Now it appears Corey Graves laid out the benefits of Becky Lynch in NXT.</p><p>As seen on last week’s episode of NXT, Becky Lynch returned<a href=#>&nbsp;to the developmental brand</a>, where it was confirmed she would challenge&nbsp;<a href=#>Tiffany Stratton for the NXT Women’s Championship on NXT this week</a>.</p><p>The highly anticipated match finally took place, as Becky Lynch duked it out with Tiffany Stratton in a solid match. When all was said and done, Big Time Becks won the match and&nbsp;<a href=#>became the new NXT Women’s Champion</a>.</p><p>While speaking on his&nbsp;<a href=#>After The Bell</a> podcast, Corey Graves talked about Becky Lynch being a part of NXT nowadays. Graves explained how Becky Lynch’s star power will give more emphasis on NXT Superstars as a whole and further develop the brand.</p><p>”Maybe you only watch Monday Night Raw, but ‘Becky Lynch is my favorite. I’m going to watch everything Becky does. Oh, she’s going to ‘NXT.’ I’m going to watch this.’ While you’re watching, while you’re waiting to see ‘The Man’ do her thing, you are now exposed to the rest of the ‘NXT’ roster.”</p><p>“You get to see what the ‘NXT’ roster is capable of. You also now have a measuring stick. Internally, from a business perspective, the higher-ups, the officials in WWE can look and say, ‘All right, we know what Becky can do. This woman won the main event of WrestleMania. How does Tiffany compare? No one expects Tiffany to be on that level yet, but can Tiffany hang? Is Tiffany capable of maybe a bigger opportunity, a bigger spotlight?”</p><p>WWE also has&nbsp;<a href=#>major plans for Becky Lynch after her NXT Women’s Title win</a>. We will have to wait and see how The Man will be booked as the NXT Women’s Champion in the coming weeks.</p><p>What do you think of Becky Lynch winning the NXT Women’s Championship?
