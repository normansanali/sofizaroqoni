It’s been over a year since 90 Day Fiancé Season 9 was filmed Biniyam’s career is taking off. According to the stats found on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tapology</a>, Bini is fighting under the name ‘Babycool’ in the “Featherweight” weight class.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Biniyam-Bini-Shibre-90-Day-Fiancé-Season-9-TLC.jpeg><p>According to the site, Biniyam has won both of the two fights he’s had so far. His last fight was on August 13, 2021, in New York at the Flex Fight MMA event. Before that, his first MMA fight was for Revolution Combat Championships in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in the featherweight category, in which he won by TKO (technical knockout).</p><h2 id=h-biniyam-s-fighting-background>Biniyam’s fighting background</h2><p>As fans know, Biniyam, AKA Babycool, fought while he was in Ethiopia. According to his bio, Biniyam began fighting at an early age. His biography explains, “Biniyam ‘Baby’ Shibre was born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He showed early athletic ability and was encouraged by his late father to begin martial arts at a young age.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ogJrRIXl0o?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p>It continues, “However, his athletic ability is not limited to one sport. He has competed in bodybuilding. He also remains active in Circus training which combines acrobatics, gymnastics, <a href=#>and performance art</a>.”</p><p>His bio reads, “He has fought as a kickboxer in Ethiopia three times. He is a member of United Africa MMA, a federation working on bringing the sport to a wider audience in East Africa.”</p><p>While Ariela may not be the happiest about Biniyam training for over four hours a day at a gym that takes almost an hour to travel to, all of the dedication is paying off. Perhaps Biniyam will achieve his dream of becoming a professional MMA fighter after all.
