Case in point: On the April 29 premiere of USA’s new comedy Playing House, Emma ditches her job in China in order to move back to her and Maggie’s hometown once she learns that eight-months-pregnant Maggie’s husband is having an online affair with a German woman.</p><p>As this preview clip from the premiere shows, that’s not where Emma’s generosity ends. In one hilarious scene, Emma dons a baseball catcher’s uniform in an effort to trap a pesky raccoon that has been terrorizing Maggie’s backyard — and let out the pent-up aggression she feels about her pal’s marriage predicament. After their raccoon ambush, Emma is understandably wiped out. “Let’s go get a drink!” she tells Maggie, only to have her request fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Veterans of New York City’s prestigious Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, real-life best friends Parham and St. Clair found that comedy came easy on the set of USA’s series — even though both women were raising infants during production.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>To help ease their workload, Parham and St. Clair, who created and executive produce the series, have enlisted a handful of guest stars to bring the laughs on Playing House.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Because we had babies and we were exhausted, we decided to cast the funniest improvisors we could so we didn’t have to do so much work,” St. Clair tells <a href=#>Yahoo TV</a> of cast members like <strong>Jane Kaczmarek</strong> and <strong>Zach Woods</strong>, along with guest stars <strong>Bobby Moynihan</strong> and <strong>Lindsay Sloane</strong>. “We write the scripts and then they give us a million alternate takes.”</p><p>Playing House premieres April 29 at 10/9C on USA Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKelmameu6h5x6isrJ1dq7alsc5mo56mnqS7brzAq5%2BapV2fsrS%2FyJyYZqukYrCtrcirZKuZk5i8sLqMnqWcp6Wjwaa%2BjGtnamxhaoFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
