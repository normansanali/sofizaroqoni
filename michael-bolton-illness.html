It prevents people from producing new brain cells. As a result, the individual suffers from brain degeneration and acute memory loss, rendering them unable to perform even the most basic of tasks on their own.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Individuals above 50 are more likely to be impacted by Samson Syndrome. However, younger people with the following disorders may be affected by it: People with a family history of Samson syndrome are more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, Down syndrome, Niemen-Pick disease Type C (NPC), and Niemen-Pick disease Type C.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>What Causes The Syndrome?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Michael Bolton’s illness is likely caused by gene changes that control how nerve cells form and deteriorate. In other words, it causes some brain cells to continue to die, impairing the brain’s capacity to function correctly. Although the specific cause of the syndrome is unknown, the following factors are likely to enhance your chances of having it:</p><p style=text-align:justify>Diabetes, age, brain inflammation, chemotherapy medicines, and other disorders injuring nerve cells are some examples. The sickness appears to arise in families following exposure to hazardous compounds such as pesticides or lead, owing to a DNA mutation. A child who has one parent with Samson Syndrome has a 50% risk of developing it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Michael-Bolton-Illness-1.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>There are currently no reports indicating if he has Samson Syndrome.
