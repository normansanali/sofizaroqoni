Foxx’s hospitalization, which has stretched on for more than three weeks now, is obviously the result of the COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>This laughable notion is already flooding sites like Twitter, as conspiracy theorists try to pin Foxx’s condition on their favorite medicinal villain. It remains unknown <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exactly what ails Foxx</a>, with his family only clueing fans into a mysterious “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">medical complication</a>,” but most people — at least the reasonable ones — are entirely content to send Foxx the prayers his friends and family have requested, and await further details once the star is back on his feet.</p><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>Rather than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">provide prayers or privacy</a>, some fans are instead on the hunt for the culprit behind Foxx’s ailment. And, rather than rationally wait to learn more, some are turning straight to the most obvious option — for those lacking the capacity to think for themselves, at least. The COVID-19 vaccine has been an antagonist in certain circles for years now, as oddball conspiracy theorists continue to insist that the life-saving vaccine is toxic, makes people magnetic, or is flooded with microchip trackers inserted by the government.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sleepless-jamie-foxx.png><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>It does none of those things, in truth. It turns out the vaccine is actually quite boring, and does little other than what it was intended for — protecting people against COVID-19, a virus that killed nearly 7 million people between March 2020 and March 2023, according to data from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johns Hopkins</a>.</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>It’s most certainly not the culprit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">behind Foxx’s hospitalization</a>, despite rampant claims littering Twitter. Peoples’ assessment that Foxx had a stroke due to the vaccine is pure lunacy, but that’s not stopping the anti-vax masses from blaming the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">poison</a>” vaccine and warning the remainder of vaccinated individuals that we’re next. Apparently we’ll all <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suffer the same consequences</a> as “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vaccine-injured</a>” folks like Foxx within the next few years.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>People with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">actual brains in their heads</a> are determined to ignore those nonsensical takeaways, instead focusing in on Foxx’s recovery. His condition doesn’t seem to be improving, based on the bare information we’ve gotten from those closest to him, but the world would be devastated to lose Foxx.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SwsLrSqaCrmZOuerW0xKipoqukqHqxtcKkZK2glWK5sMPErKtmoJGjtKq6xmadq62ZqXqwsoyao6VlpKR6psTPpZiipl2frq61xGadqLCoqHqpu9KpoK2ZnJ7HosDIqKVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
