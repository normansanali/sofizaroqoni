This time, Mr. Hands asks V to retrieve a prototype from the hands of the Scavs. Little did they know the prototype would have to be ripped from the head of a Zetatech employee. In an attempt to keep himself alive, Hasan plugged in a prototype chip to his system. I heard last time somebody did that; they ended up having to put up with a millennial terrorist douchebag.</p><p data-injection=true>In this guide, we’ll look at whether you should send Hasan back or let him go in Prototype in the Scraper.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 Balls to the Walls: Should Paco Frame Yuri, Run, or Call in Favors?</a></p><h2>Phantom Liberty Prototype in the Scraper: Send Hasan to Zetatech</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cyberpunk-Prototype-Hasen-3.jpg><p>If you choose the option “Calling the Fixer, no fast moves,” this opens up the chance to <strong>betray Hasan and send the man back to Zetatech</strong>. During the call with Mr. Hands, reveal his coordinates, and the fixer will send an escort to drive him back to his corp the day after. This ends all contact with Hasan but still gets you the same reward as the alternative: 8,000 Eurodollars and 1355 EXP.</p><h2>Phantom Liberty Prototype in the Scraper: Let Hasan Go</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cyberpunk-Prototype-Hasen-1.jpg><p>If you <strong>let Hasan go during any instance</strong>, you’ll only have the schematics to hand into Mr. Hands. If you’re fully honest with him instead of keeping the truth buried, he won’t be as disappointed in your performance.</p><p data-injection=true>Don’t just let Hassan go in the first or second instance to achieve this. Instead, choose the “Calling the Fixer, no fast moves” option, and tell <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr. Hands</a> what has happened with the operation.

Because I was playing Corpo Rat and also had a prototype chip engrained in my brain, I could easily relate to Hasan and decided to let the man go while staying honest with Mr. Hands.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs.
