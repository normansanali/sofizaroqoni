There is no greater action that exemplifies this than the 1986 Talladega 500 at the Talladega Superspeedway. This was actually a fairly ordinary race, with Bill Elliott snatching the pole and Bobby Hillin Jr winning the race.</p><p>Behind Hillin Jr were Tim Richmond and Ricky Rudd, in second and third, respectively. It is worth mentioning that this was Hillin Jr’s first and only Cup Series win in his career. Additionally, the race set the record for the most race leaders, one that would continue standing for the next 18 years. Furthermore, Bobby Hillin Jr did not endear himself to his rivals, as he got a bit rough during the race. He spun race leader Harry Gant, who went and took out Phil Parsons Darrell Waltrip, Geoff Bodine, and Cale Yarborough.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>The big talking point was before the race at Talladega Superspeedway</h2><p>Bobby Hillin Jr’s maiden Cup win was overshadowed by a truly bizarre event. As it happened, a drunk fan somehow bypassed security and wandered onto the track.</p><p>Fortunately for him, the race had not started yet, so there was no danger. Further trying to push his luck, he somehow managed to sneak into the pace car and took it for a joyride around the track.</p><p>Musician Tim Dugger said it best, “That’s when ‘hold my beer and watch this’ was invented.”</p><p>Eventually, the track authorities and security responded and fans were treated to an episode of Grand Theft Auto: NASCAR version. A police car and two motorcycles gave chase for a while, but they could not catch the thief. Finally, there was a safety truck barricade and the pace car finally stopped. However, the man was not going to be led away without a fight and brawled it out with law enforcement before being subdued.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY: </strong><span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>NASCAR’s Forgotten Legend Who Tragically Died at Talladega Super Speedway</a></span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>What was the aftermath of the bizarre incident?</h2><p>The thief was identified as a Birmingham local named Darren Crowder. He wanted to have a good time at the track; therefore, he sneaked into the ceremonial Pontiac Trans Am before the race. According to reports, the then 20-year-old managed to achieve a top speed of 100 miles an hour on the backstretch. Before the arrest, he and the police had a fine game of lock and unlock. The cops would unlock the car doors and he would promptly lock them again.</p><p>He was eventually arrested and led away in handcuffs. After the fuss died down, the race was able to go ahead without any further interruptions. At least the NASCAR Winston Cup Series drivers had a good laugh at the free entertainment. The strange incident would have definitely shaken off any of the nerves that they would have experienced before the race.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nascar-news-nascar-cup-series-team-had-their-500000-car-unbelievably-stolen-hours-before-a-race-this-past-decade?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/fb26e6ddc87882305d889f0937cbd1a5_crop_north.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">NASCAR Cup Series Team Had Their $500,000 Car Unbelievably Stolen Hours Before a Race This Past Decade</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82aqpyZomK7psPSZq6arJOderi0xKdkp5mjmK6zv4ytmKWkkZmyqK2MrKypnaKovaaxw7CYsmWipK%2BjsdGyZJuhoqm1prCMoqWfmZ2kwrR5x6ijnWWdrnqjscSrZKannZq7tXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
