But Jeff hasn't always had the <a class=hm-link href=#>muscle-honed physique</a> that he boasts today. Take a look at his transformation below.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Ex-wife of billionaire Bill Gates opens up about divorce</figure><h2>Jeff Bezos before his body transformation</h2><p id=ecLbzgGoIJh data-wc=61>Jeff Bezos, 59, acquired his fame and fortune through an online bookstore that he and his then-wife, Mackenzie Scott, founded in a garage in Washington in 1994. After studying electrical engineering and working in a series of jobs in banking and for corporate companies like D. E.

Jeff and MacKenzie met while working at D. E. Shaw in Manhattan and married in 1993.

Jeff and MacKenzie also share three younger children, another two sons and a daughter who they adopted from China.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/70a1d1d1c825-jeff-bezos-with-first-wife-mackenzie.jpg><p id=e8BT1h9SLmJB data-wc=52>In 2019, Jeff and MacKenzie announced their divorce after 25 years of marriage.
