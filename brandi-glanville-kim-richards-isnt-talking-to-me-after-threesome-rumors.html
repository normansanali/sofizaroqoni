And I said, ‘Are you joking?’”</p><p>The rumor surfaced earlier that month after podcast host <strong>Zack Peter</strong> spoke about the alleged threesome on his “<a href=#>#Nofilter</a>” podcast. At the time he claimed a source identified <a href=#>Richards</a>, 56, as one of the women Glanville has had sexual relations with in the past and alleged that the duo hooked up with an unidentified man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Brandi-Glanville-Says-Kim-Richards-Is-Not-Talking-to-Her-After-Threesome-Rumors-Claims-She-Hooked-Up-With-Carlton-Gebbia.jpg><p>The Drinking and Tweeting author addressed the threesome drama during the aforementioned November episode of her podcast.</p><p>“I think it all started when I put up a picture of <a href=#><strong>Carlton [Gebbia]</strong></a>, Kim, and I. Those are two of my favorite girls. They’re people I’m actually friends with. And that’s where I think it all started,” Glanville explained. “I’m going to make this clear, I’ve never had a threesome with Kim and Carlton, never with Kim, ever. We are just friends.”</p><p>The Drinking and Dating author then claimed that she previously hooked up with Gebbia and the mystery man.</p><p>“Carlton and I, we fooled around,” she said. “It was after her and David split up [in 2018] and we had a wild night.”</p><p>Carlton, who left <i>RHOBH</i> in 2014, has not publicly responded to her former costar’s allegations. In a trailer for season 4 of the reality show back in 2013, she was seen kissing Glanville and said, “It’s not the first time I’ve kissed a girl and it certainly won’t be the last. Brandi and I got along because we both have that wicked sense of being.</p><p>Glanville’s comments came <a href=#>months after her alleged affair drama</a> with former castmate <a href=#><strong>Denise Richards</strong></a>. The former model claimed that she had sex with Denise, 49, while visiting her on set in April 2019 — with the fallout playing out onscreen in July.</p><p>“I’m not lying,” Glanville told Us Weekly <a href=#>after the episode aired</a> about her alleged hookup with Denise. “People can say whatever they want to say. Listen, it doesn’t matter because I know my truth and the truth is setting me free right now because I don’t have to keep this f—king secret anymore.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bold and the Beautiful actress, who <a href=#>announced her departure from RHOBH</a> in September, has maintained that she’s never had sex with Glanville. The former Bravo star, however, doubled down and <a href=#>detailed an earlier steamy encounter between the two</a>. She claimed that the pair got handsy in September 2018, during a drunken bathroom hookup after meeting for dinner in Malibu.</p><p>A source exclusively told Us, however, that it “never happened” and there is no truth to Glanville’s tales. “This is just a complete fabrication and pure desperation by Brandy,” the insider said. “It sounds like a tacky porno.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpGjsap5xqWYp66ZobmmecqipGaqmZi1or7DrGSiq56perWty6Sgp59dqbxuucRmmJ%2Bslad6tbTRnpysp52aerPBzKiprGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
