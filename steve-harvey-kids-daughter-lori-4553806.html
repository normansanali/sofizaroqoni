She is a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>model</a> who has appeared on a number of magazine covers, including Vogue. But Lori really&nbsp;shot to fame thanks to her past relationship with actor <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong></a>, 35. The pair started dating around November 2020, and they went public with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the romance</a> in January 2021. Lori even gushed over the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black Panther</a>&nbsp;actor on&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Real</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>in September 2021, saying, “We just really balance each other. I really do believe in the statement when they say, ‘when you know you know.’ And I think that really applies to our situation and we just have a really good time together.” Sadly, they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split in June 2022</a>. “Michael and Lori are both completely heartbroken,” an insider told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> at the time. “They still love each other. They had great times together and brought out the best in each other.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Since the breakup, Lori has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>living her best life,</a> and she’s been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen out and about on</a> various occasions. In fact, she began a steamy romance with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Damson Idris</a>,&nbsp;</strong>and was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen out for dinner</a> with him back on December 19, signaling the beginning of the relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>The hunky Snowfall actor <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirmed the relationship</a> with a sweet PDA photo in January of 2023.

She was spotted at the same restaurant as <strong>Migos</strong> rapper <strong>Quavo</strong> in West Hollywood, but wasted no time nixing the subsequent rumors. Lori left a comment on a fan’s TikTok video, saying, “Lol no I was having lunch with my besties who are right behind me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>She was later seen out to lunch with Damson, and in mid-July, was spotted on a romantic vacation in Saint Tropez with him, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Just Jared</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KtnK%2BdXZ2us8LEsmSkoZSoeqWt1KCfrZ2iYrmwvshma25tY219d3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
