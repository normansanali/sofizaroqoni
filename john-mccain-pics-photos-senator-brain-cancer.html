The late Arizona Republican was also the father of ‘The View’ co-host, Meghan McCain.</p><p>Sen. McCain was born into a military family. Both his grandfather and father –&nbsp;John McCain Sr. and John McCain Jr. –&nbsp;were U.S. Navy admirals. Sen. McCain’s military career was marred by the five-and-a-half years that he spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. After his airplane was hit while flying over Hanoi in 1967, he was captured by the Vietnamese and tortured until his release in 1973. The beatings had a lasting physical impact on McCain and he was never able to fully raise his arms above his head again.</p><p>Married twice, he wed Cindy McCain in 1980. Together they had four children –&nbsp;daughters Meghan and Bridget and sons James and John McCain IV. He also had three children –&nbsp;Andrew, Sidney and Doug –&nbsp;with his first wife, Carol. Sen. McCain died of brain cancer in August 2018. He was 81.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLewtM1mpJybkZ67brzInKpmqJikwbC%2FjKycp5mkpL9urtGaoKdlk5a7pLHRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
