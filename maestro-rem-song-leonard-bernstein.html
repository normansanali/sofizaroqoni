The lyric originated from a <a href=#>dream</a> R.E.M. songwriter Michael Stipe had, in which he was the only one without the initials L.B. at a star-studded birthday party, according to R.E.M. Fiction: An Alternative Biography by David Buckley.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the movie, the song blares out of the speakers of a convertible with a license plate that says MAESTRO as Bernstein is arriving to teach a course to young conducting students. Given the song’s release date and the fact that <a href=#>Bernstein</a> died three years later, in 1990, this moment takes place in the final years of his life, a time when, as the movie shows in a scene when he is dancing with a young male student at club following the class, he is living more openly in his truth.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The song’s appearance in the movie is a cheeky, self-aware nod to Bernstein’s legacy and his influence on musicians of all genres. But its placement is also timely because the track just experienced a resurgence in popularity during the <a href=#>COVID-19 pandemic</a>, thanks to its apocalyptic title. In March 2020, the hit shot up to no. 4 on LyricFind’s ranking of song lyrics generating the most search queries in the U.S. Downloads of the track rose 184%, and there was a 48% up-tick in U.S. streams, according to Nielsen music data. On March 17, 2020, Stipe posted a PSA <a href=#>video</a> on Twitter, urging people not to go out and <a href=#>socialize</a> so that they wouldn’t risk spreading<a href=#> the virus</a> to others.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stipe also made <a href=#>headlines </a>in 2015 for objecting to Donald Trump’s use of the song as walk-up music at a rally on the 2016 campaign trail.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s apt that Bernstein would be featured in a rock anthem known for its “stream of consciousness” lyrics, as he had a reputation for being a particularly intense person.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He hated to be alone,” Paul R. Laird, a Leonard Bernstein scholar and musicologist at the University of Kansas, told TIME. “He was the life of every party he was at.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2Ntg3OAjqaYnqukp7xuvsSmZKynnpx6rbHOp5irnF2XsrO60q2coqZf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
