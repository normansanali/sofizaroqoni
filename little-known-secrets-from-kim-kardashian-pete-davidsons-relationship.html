The comedian has been involved with a number of famous women over the years, from Ariana Grande to Kate Beckinsale. But Kim and Pete seemed head-over-heels for each other from the start, despite the unlikely pairing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the pair eventually broke up just a few months shy of their one-year anniversary. Now that they’re no more, here’s everything we know about Pete and Kim’s whirlwind romance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Crazy Lawsuits The Kardashians Have Been Involved In</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-had-to-make-the-first-move><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kim Had To Make The First Move</span></h2><p>Kim is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. So, she likely has men fawning over her daily. But the reality star has admitted she had to make the first move after connecting with Pete on the set of Saturday Night Live in October 2021.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>, Kim said she felt a spark when she kissed Pete during a sketch. "It was just a vibe," she explained. "I was like, 'Oh s**t, maybe I just need to try something different.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to say,"Pete does not come to my after-party. Everyone was at my after-party! [He] does not give me the time of day," she continued. "I called the producer at SNL and I was like, 'Hey, do you have Pete’s number?' They were like, 'Yeah!' And I text him."</p><p>However, this wasn’t the first time Pete and Kim met. The <a href=#>pair actually met in January 2019</a> when they went out to dinner to celebrate Kid Cudi’s birthday alongside Timothee Chalamet and Kim’s then-husband Kanye West.</p><h2 id=she-was-intrigued-by-pete-rsquo-s-size><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Was Intrigued By Pete’s Size</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn’t just their onscreen kiss that made Kim interested in Pete. The Kardashians star said she was intrigued by him after hearing rumors about his size. Even Pete’s ex-fiancé Ariana Grande has made comments about his generous size.</p><p>"I wasn’t even thinking, like, 'Oh my god, I’m going to be in a relationship with him,’” Kim said. “I was just thinking, 'Heard about this BDE, need to get out there.

But they were reportedly getting very serious during their time together. Some reports said the duo were even considering moving in together. “Their relationship continues to grow,” a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. “They’re very secure with their relationship and talk future plans and moving in together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The insider also referenced their conflicting schedules, adding, “He just wants to make her happy and is making up for not being able to go with her to Kourtney’s wedding.” At the time, Pete and Kim had only been together for seven months.

That’s like my dream.” He added, “It’s like, super corny, [but] it would be so fun. Dress up the little dude. It’s just like, I’m so excited for that chapter.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Complete History Of Selena Gomez's Ex-Boyfriends</a></span></p><h2 id=pete-got-tattoos-for-kim-amp-her-kids><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Pete Got Tattoos For Kim & Her Kids</span></h2><p>Kim shares four children with her ex-husband Kanye West. Though she’s been vocal about not wanting more kids, Pete was clearly hitting it off with her children during their relationship. He was spotted spending one-on-one time with Kim’s older kids, and even appeared to get tattoo in honor of her and her children.</p><p>In May 2022, the comedian <a href=#>stepped out with the letters “KNSPC”</a> on his arm, which appear to be the first initials of Kim and her kids’ names. Pete also has <a href=#>several tattoos honoring Kim</a>, including one that says, “My girl is a lawyer.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kanye-rsquo-s-harassment-landed-pete-in-therapy><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kanye’s Harassment Landed Pete In Therapy</span></h2><p>During Pete and Kim’s relationship, her ex-husband called them out on social media a number of times. Not only did he insult Pete on numerous occasions, but Kanye even encouraged his followers to harass Pete if they saw him in public. Ye also released a song, “Eazy,” claiming he wants to “beat” Pete, and the music video for the song depicts him burying the comedian alive.</p><p>Though Kanye’s actions reportedly didn’t factor into the break-up, reports say that <a href=#>Pete has been attending trauma therapy</a> to help process the harassment he faced from Ye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pete-rsquo-s-age-may-have-been-a-problem><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Pete’s Age May Have Been A Problem</span></h2><p>Pete and Kim appeared to be going strong before they announced their break-up after nine months together, leading fans to question what went wrong. Sources said the couple’s conflicting schedules made it difficult to see each other, causing them to call the relationship off.</p><p>However, recent reports have said Kim is interested in dating someone older, suggesting her age difference with Pete may have been an issue. Kim is 41 years old, while Pete is 28. “<a href=#>Kim’s expressed she’s ready</a> to date someone older but it has to be the right person who understands her life,” an insider said. “She isn’t compromising her freedom right now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Neither Pete nor Kim have been linked to other people since their break-up. So, even if Kim is hoping to date someone closer to her age, it seems like she’s taking her sweet time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqykobJut82orqdlo5qws7HTrGSfqp%2Bieqy1zGaimqqUlsCptcCnZKmdpJp6pa3Vopusp56oerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
