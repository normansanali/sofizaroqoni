After the incident, Briere and two other people who were involved were banned from all team activities by Mercyhurst. Briere is the son of former NHL player Daniel Briere.</p><h2><strong>Who is Sydney Benes whose wheelchair Carson Briere threw down the stairs in Sullivan’s Irish Pub in viral video</strong></h2><p>Someone had helped Sydney down the stairs so she could use the bathroom with another person, leaving her empty wheelchair at the top. In a shocking video posted on social media by Sydney’s friend Julia Zutkowski, Briere is seen sitting on the chair for a few seconds before pushing it down the stairs. At the time of the accident, Sydney was not in the wheelchair.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I usually don’t post anything serious on my twitter but something happened Saturday night and just can’t stomach the thought of this kid getting away with it. In the video below is a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">@MercyhurstU</a> student and is currently on the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">@HurstMensHockey</a> team. Carson Briere. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">pic.twitter.com/kWWlEYEc7V</a></p><p>— julia (@juliazukowski) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">March 14, 2023</a></p><p>As a result of what happened, a GoFundMe page was set up to help Sydney fix her wheelchair, but she refused to take the $8,000 that was raised to buy a new one. She would rather give the money to other disabled people who might need it more.</p><p><h4>Sydney Speaks out against Carson Briere’s behavior</h4></p><p>Sydney criticised Briere’s behaviour in a series of tweets, saying that he showed “zero remorse” for what he had done. She posted a photo of herself with a bar worker and thanked Sullivan’s Irish Pub for helping her out.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y'all do too much. It could've been handled privately and off of the internet, there was no need for this debacle to be made. He could've been contacted along with his family, the school, etc. and they could've just reimbursed for damages and had a talk and now y'all are trying</p><p>— V (@vickrrm) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">March 15, 2023</a></p><p>But she wouldn’t agree that the situation could have been handled privately and off the internet. Instead, she insisted that Briere should be held responsible for what he did.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hi im Sydney and it was my chair that was pushed down the stairs. I’m so thankful for all of Sullivan’s help in this situation and the kind comments I see on Julia’s post. I swear I really don’t wanna keep a cent of the donated money, I’d much rather give it to those who need it. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">pic.twitter.com/1I5q05jdeO</a></p><p>— Sydney (@_legless_wonder) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">March 16, 2023</a></p><p>Carson Briere has since apologised for what he did. In a statement, he said that there was “no excuse” for what he did and that he will do everything he can to make up for it. His father, Daniel Briere, also said that his son’s actions were “unacceptable” and that they went against the family’s belief that people should be treated with respect.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h4>Carson Briere investigation continues after Mercyhurst player breaks team rules</h4><p>Police in Mercyhurst are said to have said that the Erie Police Department is now in charge of the investigation.&nbsp;The Walter Cronkite Sports Network said that Carson Briere and another player had been kicked out of a programme at Arizona State University “because they broke team rules.” But Mercyhurst, where he had been playing since 2021, gave him a second chance.</p><h4>Who is Carson Briere?</h4><p>Carson Briere is a young hockey player from Haddonfield, New Jersey, who has a lot of skill.
