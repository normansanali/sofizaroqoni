Watch the interview in the video above!</p><p>The 39-year-old actor stars as <a href=#>patriarch Jack Pearson</a> alongside <b><a href=#>Mandy Moore</a></b>, who plays his wife, Rebecca Pearson, on the critically acclaimed NBC family drama. He told <i>Us</i> that their onscreen chemistry is so dynamic because they’re friends in real life. “She is as nice as she presents herself to be,” Ventimiglia assured <i>Us</i>. “She is one of the kindest people, actors, I’ve come across in the business. She’s a little hard on herself. She’s a remarkable, remarkable woman.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>The <i>Gilmore Girls</i> alum revealed that one of the all-time funniest moments on set was when a bird pooped on Moore’s hat during a serious scene with <b>Sterling K. Brown</b> (who plays the adult version of Rebecca and Jack’s son Randall Pearson). “Oh, my God, Sterling is such a pro,” Ventimiglia gushed. “It was an emotional moment for Mandy’s character, and Sterling goes, ‘Hold on, I know you’re in the zone, but a bird just defecated on your hat. Can you guys see that? Can the cameras see that?’ And then she stopped and she goes, ‘Oh.’ He ushered her away, and then she came back and they popped right back in the moment.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ventimiglia gave his costars a lot of credit for holding it together during such an LOL-worthy moment. “I would have lost my mind,” he said. “I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, a bird just s–t on her, we’ve got to cut.’”</p><p>The <i>This Is Us</i> season finale airs on NBC Tuesday, March 14, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZykerexza2gpqGXobaiedGerZ6ZnKh6tbTEZp2upp6esrTAjK2foqtdnsBuwdJmmaWnn6Wys3nWbW5raWBnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
