Elsewhere, Kang and M.O.D.O.K. swap places in the hearts of MCU fans as a post-credits Easter Egg with potentially big implications is uncovered.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-marvel-officially-cared-about-wakanda-forever-way-more-than-quantumania-and-the-evidence-is-right-there-on-screen data-injectable=false>Marvel officially cared about Wakanda Forever way more than Quantumania, and the evidence is right there on screen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-13.jpg><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=887 data-injectable=true>The internet’s derived a lot of entertainment from poking fun at Quantumania‘s lackluster effects, but it turns out there’s a shocking truth behind its shoddy visuals. Anonymous members of the VFX crew have come forward to out Marvel Studios for the terrible way their team was treated, including being forced to take “shortcuts” thanks to an impossible deadline imposed on them after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wakanda Forever was prioritized to the detriment of Ant-Man 3</a>. We’ve heard similar stories before, but it’s depressing that Marvel has yet to clear up its act.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>As Kang’s credentials are called into question, MODOK manages to turn opinions around</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/modok-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania.jpg><p data-characters=644 data-current-count=944 data-injectable=true>Apparently, it’s Opposites Day today as the Marvel fandom has decided to do a complete 180 turn on its feelings about Quantumania‘s two villains. First of all, folks are now calling into question <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whether Kang is really all he claims to be</a> after his poor performance against Ant-Man suggests he’s been fibbing all along. Meanwhile, M.O.D.O.K. has earned himself a legion of new minions are people start to wake up to the fact that the big-headed bad guy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">might secretly be the best part of the movie</a>. What’s next? Will fans start saying they’re glad Luis isn’t in the film? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No way, that’s going too far</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Did you spot the key but carefully concealed Fantastic Four foreshadowing in Quantumania‘s post-credits scene?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jonathan-majors-kang-the-conqueror.jpg><p data-characters=621 data-current-count=921 data-injectable=true>Quantumania‘s post-credits scenes are naturally hugely informative about the future of the MCU’s Multiverse Saga, but an easily missed Easter Egg reveals one more connection to what’s to come in Phase Five than we knew to look for. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eagle-eyed fans have spotted a callback</a> to Mr. Fantastic’s entrance in Doctor Strange 2 that may just hint at a link between Kang and Reed Richards, who comic book fans know to be his own ancestor. Ant-Man 3 might not have been up to the mark, but there are still fantastic things ahead. Let’s just hope Marvel learns to treat its staff better along the way.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=114 data-injectable=false>Just as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Venom 3 hype train pulls out of the station</a>, prepare for another stop on the Marvel express tomorrow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbrnAq62epF2jsri%2FjLCYpJmema5uss6rnK%2BdomK2tHnOrquenF2WwG7Ax55kq52RoXqzscCspqdloaqur8DUppinoZFiwLavyp6bZpmjYsGpsYydmKujXam%2FtsDHZpibp6Wperi70aSgp59dm7yzecyaqa%2BdnGK0psDSZq6hoaOpuaauy6iup2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
