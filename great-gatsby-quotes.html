Scott Fitzgerald when he was just under the age of 30, the novel takes on dreams: Those who pray to them, those hypnotized by them, those failed and disillusioned by them.</p><p>Whatever dreams Fitzgerald may have had for his best-known book evaporated upon its 1925 publication. Some critics called the author’s style “painfully forced” and the book “a dud,” and the book sold fewer than 20,000 copies in its first run.</p><p>By the time Fitzgerald died at age 44, he had only earned $8,397 in Gatsby royalties. Though as the following passages — and critical acclaim — show, <a href=# rel=noopener>The Great Gatsby</a> as a quintessential work of American literature is invaluable:</p><p>1. “I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.”</p><p>2. “Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead.”</p><p>3. “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”</p><p>4. “You see I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-78170 alt="Great Gatsby Quote On Perseverance" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gatsby-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78170 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Gabriel Passarelli/Getty Images</span></p><p>5. “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”</p><p>6. “Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.”</p><p>7. “No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.”</p><p>8. “I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others — young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-78173 alt="Quotes From The Great Gatsby" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gatsby-4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78173 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Alija/Getty Images</span></p><p>9. “Life is much more successfully looked at from a single window.”</p><p>10. “Thirty — the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair.”</p><p>11. “His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-78171 alt="A Beautiful Little Fool Quote" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gatsby-2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78171 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Patrick Foto/Getty Images</span></p><p>12. “I hope she’ll be a fool — that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.”</p><p>13. “He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.”</p><p>14. “…what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.”</p><p>15. “Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-78172 alt="New York Summer Afternoons" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gatsby-3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78172 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Covington Portraits/Getty Images</span></p><p>16. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away.
