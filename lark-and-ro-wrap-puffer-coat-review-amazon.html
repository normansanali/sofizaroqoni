With a lofty, marshmallow-like fill, the sporty winter staple is supremely warm, and unlike your wool peacoat, its outer moisture-wicking material stands sturdy against rain and snow. But as much as puffer jackets reign supreme in cold weather, they tend to be bulky and boxy. Most lack a flattering fit, making them <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the coat of choice</a> for extra-chilly days and casual wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for a happy marriage between the two, turn to <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the Lark & Ro Short Wrap Puffer Coat</a> that's currently up to 72 percent off on Amazon, with prices starting at just $23. Shoppers call it a "fashionable take on the puffer coat" and say it's "very stylish and warm." After trying it myself, I happen to agree.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$23–$43 (Originally $85); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Featuring an exaggerated wing collar and chic wrap enclosure, this puffer certainly doesn't lack style. An attached tie at the waist adds definition where you want it most, instantly giving your body an hourglass shape, while a short, asymmetrical hemline makes your legs look like they go on for literal days. Also cropped, bracelet-style sleeves are wide enough to balance out your itty-bitty waistline, and pockets on both sides come in handy for stashing essentials.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But regardless of its sleek, party-ready style, the jacket still offers all of the same features <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>you'd expect from a standard puffer</a>. Upon first feel, you'll notice how lightweight it is — a major plus for free movement, but don't let that fool you; reviewers say its plush poly-microfiber fill is cozy enough to keep "warm in 30-degree weather." And while this jacket doesn't come with a hood, Lark & Ro's proprietary water-resistant finish will protect you against inevitable precipitation.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$23–$43 (Originally $85); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Available in two colors, this puffer saves the day when it's so freezing, I'm tempted to forgo fashion in lieu of a coat that makes me look seven times my size. I love that I never have to choose between style and comfort, because it truly has both, and I find myself reaching for it constantly. From weekend errand runs to more formal date-night dinners, it's a versatile go-to that reaps heaps of compliments practically every direction I turn. I'd suggest sizing down, but otherwise, it's not only the most flattering puffer I own, but also the most flattering coat I own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Lark & Ro Short Wrap Puffer Coat</a> is an elevated outerwear piece I can't recommend enough.
