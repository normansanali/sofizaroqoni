And if you took them at their word, you might believe it! The town has rows of brick buildings that are reminiscent of just about any small town in America and make you ask the question: where was “Roxanne” filmed?</p><p>As it turns out, the production wasn’t actually in the United States but in a town called <a href=#>Nelson</a> in British Columbia, Canada. When “Roxanne” came to Nelson, it was a first for the locals, who never expected to host a Steve Martin movie.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Castlegar News,</a> the town was deep into a revitalization project to restore many of its Victorian-era buildings. As it turned out, this was exactly what the production was looking for: “Nelson appealed to the location scout because they were looking for a place with Victorian architecture that could stand in for a Washington ski town. In particular they wanted a lush Victorian house and various bars, including a club that is in a cellar.”</p><p>They found it all in Nelson and completed the shoot over the course of three weeks. Both Steve Martin and Rick Rossovich’s characters worked for the fire department. So the town of Nelson’s fire department chipped in quite a bit to help complete the movie. The town is proud of its legacy as the filming location for “Roxanne,” and it led to them having more movies filmed there. Some of the more <a href=#>recent titles filmed in Nelson</a> include “Age of Adaline” in 2015 and “The Tall Man” in 2012.</p><p>Some of the notable locations that you’ll see if you go to Nelson and take the “Roxanne” walking tour include the old fire station, the barn, and the “All Things Dead” shop, according to <a href=#>IMDB.</a> For many of the interiors and a few of the exterior shots, the production went to Vancouver, one of the biggest filming hubs in the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where did they film the bar scene in “Roxanne”?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/st-paul-Restaurant-Dining-Room-Pastel-Pink-Walls-Custom-Wood-1024x683.webp><p>One of the most memorable scenes from “Roxanne” is when the characters are having a night out at Dixie’s Cafe. After receiving some ribbing from another patron, C.D. delivers 20 jokes at his own expense and wins over the rest of the bar. This is another one of those classic scenes that makes you want to ask the question: where was “Roxanne” filmed?</p><p>Thankfully you can still visit this location today. According to <a href=#>TV Hulk</a>, the actual building is Jackson’s Hole and Grill. Located at 524 Vernon Street in the city of Nelson, you can still have a meal in this historic building and reminisce on the hilarious scene.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where did they film Roxanne’s house?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/Historic-Waterfront-Queen-Anne-Victorian-interior-1024x683.webp><p>Another location where some of the movie’s most memorable scenes take place is Roxanne’s gorgeous Victorian home. There we see the scene where Steve Martin’s C.D. helps Chris by impersonating him and wooing Roxanne outside her window. The home is unmistakably beautiful and certainly makes you ask the question: where was “Roxanne” filmed?</p><p>According to <a href=#>IMDB,</a> they filmed Roxanne’s house in the town of Anmore in British Columbia. If you want to see this home for yourself, please keep in mind that it is a private residence. Therefore, you should not do anything to disturb the people who reside there.</p><p>As for the home that belonged to Steve Martin’s character, <a href=#>Castlegar News</a> reports that it’s unknown exactly where it is. They speculate that it’s somewhere in the Lower Mainland.</p><p><strong>Do “Roxanne” and “Big Sky” possibly share filming locations? <a href=#>Find out here!</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbHEq6qpmZOae6S7zGipnqufqr%2BksdJorqGdopp6uK3SZqmosJGju6Z5xaKjpp2UZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
