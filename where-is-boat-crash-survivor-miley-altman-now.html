Learn Everything About Miley Altman</strong></p><p>All but Mallory Beach, according to the news source, reached the coast. Beach’s body was discovered seven days later.</p><p>The Daily Mail claims that the DNA samples of all four survivors have already been sent to the Police.</p><p><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>According to the source, the four are Paul’s former girlfriend, Morgan Doughty, and Beach’s boyfriend, Anthony Cook, Connor Cook, Anthony’s cousin; and Miley Altman, Connor’s girlfriend. Beach’s relatives also submitted DNA samples, the study said.</span></p><p>The State Law Enforcement Division’s Tommy Crosby, a spokesperson, revealed to the Mail that Police have also acquired digital and telephone records to track people’s activities on and around the day of the murders.</p><p>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Who Is Khurram Qadeer Baig? Sana Bucha Husband, Family And Net Worth</a></p><h2>Where is Miley Altman Now?</h2><p>Fortunately, Miley did not sustain any significant injuries, but she was immediately brought to the hospital for a checkup before the Police approached her individually to obtain a statement.</p><p>Therefore, she revealed the truth by clarifying that Paul, not Connor, as he and his well-known Murdaugh family had initially sought to pretend, was driving the boat, just like Anthony, Morgan, and Connor had done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/murdaugh-investigation.jpg><p>Then she returned to the area hoping to be there when her best friend, whom she had known since she was a kid, was found. Yet it was at this point that she understood how severe the circumstance was.</p><p>When Mallory’s remains were discovered eight days later, Miley’s heart was even more broken because it was verified that the person she loved the most would never again be by her side.</p><p>It is important to note that Paul was charged with three counts of driving under the influence, causing death or serious bodily injury three months after the incident.</p><p>This is because on June 7, 2021, he and his mother, Margaret “Maggie” Murdaugh, were brutally killed at the family’s hunting lodge in Islandton, South Carolina.</p><h2>Who is Miley Altman?</h2><p>Miley and Mallory first met in the early 2000s while attending the same preschool, and they decided to establish a long-lasting friendship based on an open, pleasant relationship.</p><p>The former remarked, “She came up to me and told me I was attractive; the rest is history,” in the Netflix original. I was just a shy little girl.</p><p>She was a chatty little thing which never stopped talking. But the “three M’s” of Low Country never failed to compliment one another well, and it wasn’t until Morgan Doughty joined the group in their early adolescent years that things took off.</p><p>The trio obtained jobs at Retail Therapy and began dating people from their more extensive social network, which allowed them to hang out even more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Deadly-Murdaugh-boat-crash.jpg><p>But this was no surprise given that they come from a relatively small town where everyone knows everyone on some level due to the ingrained community values.</p><p>While Mallory was blissfully involved with Anthony Cook, Miley was dating Connor Cook, the first cousin and best friend of Anthony Cook, and Morgan had been Paul Murdaugh’s girlfriend for around four years.</p><h2>Who Are Mallory Beach’s Parents?</h2><p>The youngest of her parent’s three children, Mallory Beach, was the joy of their lives when she was born in April 1999.</p><p>Mallory Searson Beach and Phillip Harley Beach had three other daughters. The latter remembers with joy how much his daughter loved to hunt and looked forward to a challenge when she was younger.</p><p>Philip added that regardless of whether they were her close friends or total strangers, his daughter has consistently demonstrated genuine concern for people.</p><p>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Zac Efron Face Accident: Did He Have A Plastic Surgery?
