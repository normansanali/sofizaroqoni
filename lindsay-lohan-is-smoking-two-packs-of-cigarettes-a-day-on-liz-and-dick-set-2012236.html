A source tell <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> the actress is smoking two packs of cigarettes a day on the set.</p><p>“Literally every time she finishes a scene she lights up another cigarette,” the source explains. “You can hear the crew saying, ‘That’s cut — get a cigarette for Lindsay.’ “</p><p>Lohan is channeling Elizabeth Taylor opposite <strong>Grant Bowler</strong> (Richard Burton) for the role, which is her first lead role since 2009’s Labor Pains.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“In between takes she would sit on the director’s chair puffing on her cigarettes,” the source tells <strong>Us</strong>. “Lindsay has been working hard, but without the nicotine she probably could not make it through as she appears stressed at times and they do seem to calm her down.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>After false reports circulated last week that Lohan was found unconscious and rushed to an L.A. hospital, Lohan <a href=#>tweeted</a>, “Note to self.. After working 85 hours in four days, and being up all night shooting, be very aware that you might pass out from exhaustion and seven paramedics might show up at your door… Hopefully they’re cute. Otherwise it would be a real let down.”</p><p>Her rep explained to <strong>Us</strong>, “She took a nap before shooting her scene. Producers were concerned when she did not come out of her room and called paramedics as a precaution. Lindsay was never taken to a hospital. She was examined and is fine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZ6ZwKLFjKWmoZmeYra0edKmpqShnpx6tcPOZqeam5uoerCyjJygoJmimsG1sdJmmGacka56sLqMpaCzZZGjsW6wyJyiZquVqXpzfJBraWxuXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
