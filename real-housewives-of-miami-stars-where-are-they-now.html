After launching shows in Orange County, New York City, Atlanta, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and Beverly Hills, Bravo created the Real Housewives of Miami.</p><p>Season 1, which starred<strong> Lea Black, Adriana de Moura, Alexia Echevarria, Marysol Patton, <a href=#>Larsa Pippen </a></strong>and<strong> Cristy Rice,</strong> premiered in February 2011. After Larsa and Cristy left the series, <strong><a href=#>Lisa Hochstein</a>, <a href=#>Joanna Krupa</a>, Ana Quincoces </strong>and<strong> Karent Sierra</strong> joined the cast for seasons 2 and 3.

The scheduling might have had something to do with it because they [Bravo] changed every week, it was on a different night or different times so that was a little confusing,” she said in December 2016. “For me, it was just a blip on my radar, it was four years, 30 episodes, three seasons out of my life. I met some interesting people, some of it was a bit of fun and I learned some hard lessons you know things you not only experienced in life, like people willing to do anything for attention.”</p><p><strong>Listen! ‘RHOP’ star Wendy Osefo breaks down the “most intense fight in the show’s history” in under 2 minutes.</strong></p><p>Three years later, Lisa made headlines when she told Page Six that she was “super close” to Alexia, Marysol and Adriana.</p><p>“Who wouldn’t be interesting a reboot?” she quipped in June 2019.</p><p>While Bravo has yet to express interest in bringing back RHOM, the network aired a season 3 marathon in April 2020 to encourage fans to stay home amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Scroll through for an update on the former ‘wives:</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Usmagazine.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqpWWuW60zq6qnq%2BZq7K0ec6fZKahkaK2br%2FTmqmsZaedsrOxjJqpnmWknbK6ec2ormg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
