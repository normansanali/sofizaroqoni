Viewers simply love the idea of playing along and seeing how far they would get in the hot seat. With his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">personable nature</a>, original host <strong>Regis Philbin</strong> helped contestants&nbsp;feel at ease, thereby making the feat of reaching the million dollar question feel slightly less daunting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Are The World's Longest-Running Game Shows</a></span></p><p>But despite feeling like a staple of US television, the series actually originated in the UK, a year before the American version. Subsequently, there have been multiple international incarnations of the hit show, from Russia to India. When watching the original UK series, we can't help but notice some glaring differences to the US show, many of which are hard to ignore. Here are 10 major differences between the US and&nbsp;UK&nbsp;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.</p><h2 id=uk-winnings-aren-t-taxed><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>UK Winnings Aren't Taxed</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, any money won on the US show&nbsp;is taxed in line with federal tax law. But in the UK version, contestants get to keep all their money, as lottery winnings are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tax exempt</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, less tax may be paid on the US <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity specials</a>, as charitable contributions generally mean a smaller tax bill.</p><h2 id=winning-the-jackpot-is-a-bigger-deal-in-the-uk-show><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Winning The Jackpot Is A Bigger Deal In The UK Show</span></h2><p>When John Carpenter became the first ever person to win the million dollars, Regis Philbin spent no time prolonging the anxiety of the lucky contestant. Instead, Regis gleefully announced that John had won before his answer even turned green.</p><p>But in the UK show, winning the million is made into a massive (and nerve-wracking)</p><p>deal. When the UK's first ever winner, Judith Keppel, uttered that immortal line, "final answer", host Chris Tarrant stared at her for almost 10 seconds and pulled worried faces before announcing she had won.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-uk-host-trolls-the-contestants><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The UK Host Trolls The Contestants</span></h2><p>The US show has had a number of hosts, with the late and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">much loved</a> Regis Philbin&nbsp;being the first.&nbsp;Philbin&nbsp;never attempted to amplify the anxiety of the contestants by dwelling on their final answers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Regis Philbin Enjoyed His Last Year</a></span></p><p>But the host of the original UK show, Chris Tarrant, was renowned for trolling the contestants. The poker-faced Tarrant would frequently prolong the show when contestants were at their most anxious, often throwing them off course with queries of "you confident?" or "sure it isn't B?" In fact, Tarrant's trolling became so notorious that comedian Peter Serafinowicz perfectly parodied him in this 2007 skit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-can-win-much-more-in-the-us-show><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>You Can Win Much More In The US Show</span></h2><p>In the UK&nbsp;Millionaire,&nbsp;contestants can never win more than the million. However, US contestants can potentially win several million dollars, as the prize money was increased by $10,000 every time an episode ended without a winner. In 2001, Kevin Olmstead became the first person to win more than $1 million on the show, leaving with an incredible $2.18 million.</p><h2 id=there-are-different-lifelines><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>There Are Different Lifelines</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the US show's 2008-2010 run, there was an option to "Ask the Expert". No such lifeline exists in the UK show, which solely had "Ask the Audience", "50/50", and "Phone a Friend" up until its 2018 revival, which added "Ask the Host". The US show didn't add the latter lifeline until 2 years after its UK counterpart.</p><h2 id=the-uk-show-has-eccentric-characters><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The UK Show Has Eccentric Characters...</span></h2><p>Is there anything more British than contestant Colin Hallet clumsily spelling out all the options during his "Phone a Friend", only to have to repeat himself with 3 seconds remaining? What makes this even better is that his "Phone a Friend" manages to nonchalantly squeeze in the right answer with less than a second remaining.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-the-us-show-has-eccentric-characters-like-this-guy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>...But The US Show Has Eccentric Characters Like This Guy</span></h2><p>Quirky contestant Alan Carver had no time to waste and blurted out his final answers before host Meredith Vieira had even finished reading out the questions.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Meredith Vieira Been Up To Since 'Today Show'?</a></span></p><p>Although he initially comes off as arrogant, Alan actually starts crying halfway through the show, clearly exhibiting his amazement at having made it so far, and Meredith gives him a hug. In the end, his impulsivity is ultimately his downfall and he leaves with $25,000.</p><h2 id=there-was-a-cheating-scandal-on-the-uk-show><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>There Was A Cheating Scandal On The UK Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one of the most quintessentially English scandals ever,&nbsp;British Army Major Charles Ingram was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">convicted of cheating</a> his way to a million pounds in 2001. According to prosecutors, Charles got his wife, Diana, and his friend, Tecwen, to cough every time he read out the correct answer. Subsequently, Charles had to give back his Â£1 million,&nbsp;but he is adamant of his innocence to this day&nbsp;and claims&nbsp;that the coughs were merely coincidental.</p><h2 id=the-uk-rules-are-harsher><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The UK Rules Are Harsher</span></h2><p>In the 2015 version of the US Millionaire, contestants who give an incorrect answer before the fifth question automatically go home with $1,000, even if they haven't reached that amount.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the UK show is more ruthless, as contestants will go home with absolutely nothing if they get an answer wrong within the first 5 questions.</p><h2 id=the-us-show-has-more-diverse-contestants><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The US Show Has More Diverse Contestants</span></h2><p>When Millionaire first began in the UK, the contestants were notably identikit: all white, from financially secure upper middle class backgrounds, and mostly middle aged and older. Meanwhile,&nbsp;the US version had contestants from all backgrounds and age ranges. The new UK series, however, has made amends and begun to diversify its contestants.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Best Celebrity Gameshow Hosts, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWdlrewvoydoJ%2Belaeyr6%2FErGSbnaSssqa6jLCfqGWnlru1v4ytpmaalWKubrnIpaOip56WtrOxjKKlZqyYmnq2t4yapZ1lpJ2ybsHSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
