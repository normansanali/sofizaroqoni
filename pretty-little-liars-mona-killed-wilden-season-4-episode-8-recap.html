They’re still fine. (Sorry to get you all worried there.) There was a pretty big twist, though, when Mona showed up to the police station and confessed to killing Wilden herself! What does she have up her sleeve?!</p><h3>Did Wilden Kill Toby’s Mom?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Meanwhile, Spencer (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Troian Bellisario</strong></a>) dug deeper into the mystery of what&nbsp;really&nbsp;happened to Toby’s (<strong>Keegan Allen</strong>) mother. Her most unsettling discovery was that Wilden had faked her death report, and now she’s convinced that someone&nbsp;else&nbsp;wanted to see him dead. You know, besides Hanna. And Hanna’s mom. And everybody else in town.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Unfortunately, Spencer’s mom — aka&nbsp;<strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong>‘s stunt double — wasn’t having any of her daughter’s suspicions. I guess Spencer’s going to have take matters into her own hands… again.</p><h3>Aria’s Bro-blems</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>A few blocks over, Aria (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lucy Hale</strong></a>) was up to her pretty little neck in family problems. After finding out that Mike’s (<strong>Cody Christian</strong>) teammates have been giving him a hard time, she nearly freaked out when she thought he had passed out drunk at a party. So who did she call for help? Her dashing, responsible ex-boyfriend Ezra (<strong>Ian Harding</strong>), perhaps? Nope! She punched in Jake’s (<strong>Ryan Guzman</strong>) digits, and he came running to her side in no time flat.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Once they realized Mike was fine, Aria and Jake had themselves a mini-date, only they didn’t call it a date. Even when they saw a commercial for <i>Insidious Chapter 2&nbsp;</i>— that was some A+ product placement, by the way — Aria refused to call their future movie outing a date. She came pretty close, though!</p><h3>Tears Of A Mom</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>And it was a rough week for the Fields family, as Emily (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shay Mitchell</strong></a>) and her mom dealt with the aftermath of that random car driving into their living room last week. While Emily looked to the future — she met with her old Habitat For Humanity supervisor (<strong>Rumer Willis</strong>) for a recommendation and another potential trip — Mrs. Fields (<strong>Nia Peeples</strong>) completely fell apart, faced with the mountain of stressful struggles in her life. In fact, she literally broke down at the end of the episode, crying in her daughter’s arms. (Am I the only one who&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;handle watching moms cry? It kills me every time!)</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of this week’s episode? Any new predictions for the future? It was a hectic episode, so before you drop a comment, enjoy&nbsp;<strong>Mikey Wax</strong>‘s song “In Case I Go Again,” which was featured on tonight’s episode!</p><h3>LISTEN: Mikey Wax’s ‘In Case I Go Again’</h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>— Andy Swift</strong><br><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @AndySwift</a></p><h3>More ‘Pretty Little Liars’:</h3><li>‘Pretty Little Liars’ Scoop: Who’s Drowning In Rosewood?</li><li>‘Pretty Little Liars’ Recap: Caleb & Toby Team Up To Find Red Coat</li><li><a href=#>‘Pretty Little Liars’ Recap: A Suspect Is Arrested For Wilden’s Murder</a></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH14e5JpZqmqlanBunnLoqutpJViuaqt0axkpqeelnqstculnJ1lp565pbHNZqqemaOku26AjJ6noqufmbJuhIyrnJyZoGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
