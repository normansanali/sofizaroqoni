Here's the entire story from their maybe not-so-cute meet-cute to the "Yummy" music video.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2009></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2009</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back when they were just pre-teens, Bieber met Baldwin on the set of the Today show. Hailey's dad, Steven, introduced the two of them, and thankfully, it was all captured in a video. It's about as awkward as any interaction involving Bieber's bowl cut and a famous dad can be.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2011></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2011</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It would be another two years before the two were photographed together in public. Steven Baldwin can take credit for this one too since he and his daughter made an appearance at the premiere of Bieber's film, Never Say Never. It was the same year Bieber confirmed his relationship with Selena Gomez.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2014></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2014</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bieber and Gomez take one was dunzo by 2014. By now, Hailey had formed a friendship with Kendall Jenner, who happened to be pals with Bieber. The trio was spotted at Hillsong Church in New York City in November. The sparks weren't there just yet, according to Hailey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've known him since I was so young — since I was like 13 — and we've just been good friends over the years," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told E! News</a> after the images surfaced. "We have just stayed close and there's nothing more to it than that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hailey brushed off the rumors again when followers spotted her in Bieber's New Years Instagram post.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2015></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2015</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's just going through a time in his life where he's transitioning in a really positive way and he needs good people around him," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she said</a>. "And I'm trying to be a good friend and be there for him and support him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two seemed to end the year just like they started it. Hailey appeared in Bieber's end-of-year video, too. The two were in Anguilla.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2016></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2016</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It wasn't until 2016 that the two made things official. They announced the news on Instagram with a sweet kissing video. Still, things aren't serious. According to Hailey, things are "complicated."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We are not an exclusive couple," Baldwin told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>E! News</a>. "He's about to go on tour. Relationships at this age are already complicated, but I don't really like to talk about it because it's between me and him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For his part, Bieber said that he's too "busy" for a relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I already have a lot that I have to commit to. A lot of responsibilities," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GQ</a>. "I don't want to feel like the girl I love is an added responsibility."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mark R.

Hailey said that she and Bieber had moved beyond their pasts and were looking forward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We went through a long period of time when we weren’t friends. We didn’t speak for quite some time, and there was a lot of weirdness that went on. We’ve moved past that," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Times</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They were spotted kissing in June and in July, Bieber let his Instagram followers know that they were engaged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September, the two were married at a New York City courthouse. It was a secret, but when news broke, sources close to the couple said that they wanted to show everyone that their love was real.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The city hall marriage was her idea. It was 'you and me against the world,'" a source <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a>. "Let's show [everyone] we're serious and it's not just some crazy fling." Then, in November, Hailey changed the name on her Instagram profile to "Hailey Bieber."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2019></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2019</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instagram-official, courthouse-official, Vogue-official. The two shared a cover and Bieber told everyone that the two waited until marriage before they were intimate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I saw her last June, I just forgot how much I loved her and how much I missed her and how much of a positive impact she made on my life," Bieber <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Vogue</a>. "I was like, 'Holy cow, this is what I've been looking for.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March, after rumors of marital strife made headlines — sources claimed that he married Hailey to get back at his ex — Bieber responded on Instagram.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>justinbieber/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Why would I dedicate my whole life to someone in marriage to get back and [sic] my ex," he wrote. "I absolutely loved and love Selena she will always hold a place in my heart," he continued. "But I am head over heels with my wife and she is absolutely the BEST THING that has ever happened to me period."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An Instagram post in November teased children in the couple's future.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Next season BABIES," he wrote. The post came after the couple's second wedding in South Carolina. Guests included Hailey's model pals Kendall Jenner, Camila Morrone, and Joan Smalls, Kylie Jenner, and her daughter Stormi, Usher, Jaden Smith, and Kris Jenner.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2020></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2020</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Biebers started the new decade with a new tune, "Yummy." Hailey appeared in the music video and Bieber said that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the song's lyrics</a> referenced his romance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Bieber came forward with his Lyme disease and depression, many criticized him, but Hailey offered words of support and clapped back at the trolls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For those who are trying to downplay the severity of Lyme disease. Please do your research and listen to the stories of people who have suffered with it for years," she tweeted. "Making fun of and belittling a disease you don’t understand is never the way, all it takes is educating yourself."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeYlratsdhmmaKdkpq%2FbrbUrKuipl2XtqauxKtkq52clsGqu82sn6Ko</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
