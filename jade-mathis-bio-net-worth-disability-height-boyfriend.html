She is also the first child to follow in her father’s footsteps and reach beyond as an attorney, public speaker, and mental health advocate.</span></p><p>Keep reading this Jade Mathis Bio to learn more about her.</p><h3><b>Jade Mathis On Mathis Family Matters</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>E!’s new reality TV series </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mathis Family Matters</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> premiered on June 19, 2022, and the show featured the daily life of the honorable judge Greg Mathis, his wife Linda Mathis, and their kids, Greg Jr, Camara, Amir, and our star, Jade Mathis.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Well, though some may be seeing Jade’s father Greg for the first time, the judge is certainly not new to the reality TV scene. Prior to this, he was the face of the Emmy Award-winning television court show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Judge Mathis</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. However, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mathis Family Matters</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was definitely the first show which followed all the Mathis family members.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Excited to share this moment with you all. Don’t miss #MathisFamilyMatters premiering June 19th only on @eentertainment,” Jade promoted </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mathis Family Matters </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>over her IG.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, equally excited were her siblings/co-stars, Camara Mathis Webb (second child, a lawyer, a wife, and mother to two beautiful daughters), Greg Mathis Jr. (third child, a.k.a. “Bobby”, and a real estate agent who ventured with his boyfriend, Elliott), and Amir Mathis (the youngest, an established television producer and a talented networker).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For those who haven’t heard about Jade’s mother, Linda is a teacher and an entrepreneur who transitioned her career to dedicate all her time to focus on the children, household, and family life. She married Judge Greg right after graduating from college and welcomed their brood in Detroit, Mich. In 2005, the Mathis family then moved to Los Angeles and resided there ever since.</span></p><h3><b>Jade Mathis Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jade Mathis is an attorney, public speaker, and mental health advocate located in the Washington D.C. area. She founded </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Resilient JEM, LLC</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in October 2021 to educate marginalized minorities on how to own their story and excel, provoke resilience, and empower them to execute strategic plans that will accelerate their lives.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Jade, her initiatives included continued work on criminal justice reform, motivational speaking, and advocacy for mental health awareness.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Following the footsteps of her father, and also after receiving a life-changing mental health diagnosis while in college, Jade became determined to change the way the world views mental health. Since then, she’s captured the attention of millions across the world, not only by sharing her story of resilience and perseverance but also with her bold, authentic, unapologetic, and unashamed approach to addressing mental health.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dubbed the “Expungement Guru,” Jade has also firsthand observed the disparities and deficits in the criminal justice system and created diversion programs as alternatives to incarceration.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prior to this, Jade worked as an Assistant State’s Attorney for Prince George’s County Maryland for 7 long years. At the end of her tenure in Oct 2021, Jade then took it to her IG to write, “The most valuable lesson I’ve learned working on the frontlines of the Criminal Justice System is sometimes justice isn’t incarceration, its reform, and rehabilitation. Being a nontraditional prosecutor has been one of my proudest achievements. Although today is my last day serving in this capacity, it is not my last day fighting for the voiceless and advocating for reform.”</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Jade Mathis Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jade Mathis flaunted a net worth of under $2 million in 2022. On the other hand, her father Greg Mathis boasted a net worth of $20 million then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In case you’re curious, an assistant states attorney in 2019 made around $71 thousand per annum. So, this was perhaps how much Jade earned annually as well.</span></p><h3><b>Jade Mathis Disability</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jade Mathis was diagnosed with depression and ADHD in 2006. She was in her sophomore year of college studying broadcast journalism at a university in Georgia then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I was at home in bed all day with the windows (and) the blinds closed, just in the dark, random crying and overwhelming sadness,” she recalled. Also, since her grades were taking a hit at school, she opened up to her father about it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Judge Greg then immediately asked to go see a psychologist. And so she did.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After being diagnosed, Jade then learned to “protect her ears.” Not literally but as to what she listens to and what she watches. “I was a news junkie, but I had to pull back from the news. I had to pull back from certain reality shows,” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Jade learned to advocate on her own behalf, and over time, she found herself helping people around her struggling with mental health as well. Her one piece of advice to people struggling with themself is to be resilient and be able to bounce back.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, Jade’s thankful for her invisible disability, for it has led her to be able to help many like her.</span></p><h3><b>Jade Mathis Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jade Mathis stands tall at a height above 5 feet 6 inches (167 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Does Jade Mathis Have A Boyfriend?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jade Mathis didn’t seem to have a boyfriend as of 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Well, given that she suffered from depression and ADHD most of her early life, she might have struggled to keep a dating life as well. Or perhaps, Jade might already have a secret boyfriend for all we know.</span></p><h3><b>Jade Mathis Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jade Mathis was 37 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mathis Family Matters</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>When Is Jade Mathis Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jade receives her birthday wishes on September 2 and is of the Virgo zodiac.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Is Jade Mathis On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>jademathisofficial</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s her Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>JadeMathisOfficial</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>jmathisofficial</span></a>.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmo5mUmnqurdOhoKxlkp68brrErWSwp6KptW6wyKyYm6GcnsG6eceeoKCgpGKvsMXFq6CeppRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
