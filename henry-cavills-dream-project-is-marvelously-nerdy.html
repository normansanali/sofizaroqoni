And in an exclusive interview with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Empire Magazine’s Pilot TV podcast</a>, Cavil revealed his dream project. Unsurprisingly, this project is just as geeky as you would expect.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>During the interview, Cavill discussed the new season of&nbsp;The Witcher,&nbsp;his love of the videogames, and his desire to make the series accurate to the books. Near the end of the interview, the host asked Cavill about his love of Warhammer 40K and asks why there has never been a decent adaptation of the legendary Games Workshop sci-fi franchise.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>In response, Cavill said that he would love to do something set in the 40K universe. When the host suggested that he take the role of fan-favorite character Gregor Eisenhorn, the legendary Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos, Cavill quickly responded.</p><p>“I don’t know about Eisenhorn necessarily, when you’ve got Valdor and Primarchs out there, then it seems a shame to be a mere inquisitor. But I would absolutely leap at that opportunity. It’s something I would be very, very excited to do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FGgH1lwXMAIc18G.jpg><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>However, despite his radiant enthusiasm for the idea, Cavill notes that he’s glad Games Workshop,&nbsp;Warhammer 40K’s&nbsp;owners, have been protective of their IP and that there are not “loads of TV shows and movies and stuff done poorly.”</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>Cavill also said that if a&nbsp;Warhammer 40K&nbsp;series ever happened, it would need to be done “perfectly” and “to a Lord Of The Rings level.” He also noted that he would be happy to do&nbsp;Warhammer 40K’s&nbsp;prequel series&nbsp;Warhammer 30K,&nbsp;or even&nbsp;Warhammer Fantasy.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>He summarized the segment by saying that the Games Workshop worlds are “so rich” and that the universe is “so exciting.” He said that a series based on them is the “true dream job opportunity” and that if he had the chance to show them in live-action, he would be “ecstatic.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>This isn’t the first time Cavill’s love of Warhammer 40K has been on display. Recently a clip of Cavill talking about&nbsp;Warhammer&nbsp;on the Graham Norton Show went viral on Twitter. Many users were upset at how condescending Norton was towards Cavill’s hobby, leading to many people Tweeting in support of the star.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=false>Only time will tell if a&nbsp;Warhammer 40K&nbsp;series comes to fruition. However, if Games Workshop ever decides to take the plunge, it seems clear that <strong>Henry Cavill</strong> will be first in line at the auditions, waiting to realize his dreams.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypsc2rsGabkau2rbjSZpurnZGierG%2BzqOcnKxdnsBuucCrrZ6kn6rArcWMp5yrnKlk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
