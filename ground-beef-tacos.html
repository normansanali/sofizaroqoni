We literally ate them at least once a week!&nbsp;</p><p>To this day, this is one of the go-to meals that he wants me to make so it is shocking that these homemade tacos haven’t made their debut on Modern Honey yet.&nbsp;</p><p>These Ground Beef Tacos are so easy, super delicious, and can be made in less than 30 minutes. Plus these tacos are customizable so you can top them with all of your favorite toppings.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ground-Beef-Tacos-1-720x819.jpg alt="These homemade Ground Beef Tacos are made with spiced taco meat loaded into fried taco shells.

They take no time at all and make a big difference in flavor.</li><li>My <strong>family loves them</strong>! My kids and husband are always happy when tacos are served so that makes my job easier.&nbsp;</li><h2>Ground Beef Taco Ingredients:</h2><ul><li><strong>Ground Beef</strong> — I suggest using 80-85% lean ground beef in this recipe. If you use 80/20 ground beef, you will have some extra grease. You can drain it or blot the grease with a paper towel.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Onion</strong> — use diced red, white, or yellow onions in these homemade tacos.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Taco Seasoning</strong> — is made up of spices like chili powder, cumin, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. If you want extra flavor, add more taco seasoning.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Tomato Sauce</strong> — this helps to keep the ground beef extra moist, tender, and flavorful. Buy the tomato sauce without any add-ins (such as oregano, basil, etc).</li><li><strong>Corn Tortillas</strong> — I suggest using white corn tortillas in this recipe.</li><li><strong>Oil</strong> — use basic cooking oils like canola or vegetable to fry the corn tortilla shells.</li><li><strong>Pepper</strong></li></ul><h3>Ground Beef Taco Toppings:</h3><ul><li><strong>Cheese</strong></li><li><strong>Guacamole</strong></li><li><strong>Salsa</strong></li><li><strong>Sour Cream</strong></li><li><strong>Diced Fresh Tomatoes</strong></li><li><strong>Lettuce</strong></li></ul><p>The sky is the limit with the toppings on tacos. You can also drizzle on some queso, sprinkle on some green onions, pour on the hot sauce, or sprinkle with cilantro.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ground-Beef-Tacos-10-720x805.jpg alt="These homemade Ground Beef Tacos are made with spiced taco meat loaded into fried taco shells.

Cook until the ground beef is browned and no longer pink. Blot any extra grease from the pan using a paper towel.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add the taco seasoning</strong>, pepper, and tomato sauce. Stir to coat the ground beef.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 3: Heat oil in a skillet</strong>. Once it is heated, fry the corn tortillas on both sides, remove the tortillas, and fold them in half to form their taco shape. I like to use tongs for this action.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Place the fried taco shells</strong> on paper towels to drain.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 5: Fill the tortillas with the ground beef mixture</strong>. Top with cheese, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, or any other toppings you would like!</p><p><strong>Step 6: Serve warm</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ground-Beef-Tacos-13-720x598.jpg alt="These homemade Ground Beef Tacos are made with spiced taco meat loaded into fried taco shells.
