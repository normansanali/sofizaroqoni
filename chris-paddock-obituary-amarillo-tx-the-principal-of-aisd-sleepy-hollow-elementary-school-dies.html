Paddock reportedly worked as a teacher, coach, and leader at Fannin Middle School, Travis Middle School, Caprock High School, Palo Duro High School, and Sleepy Hollow Elementary School, according to a post made by the AISD.<br>On Saturday, it was confirmed by authorities from the Amarillo Independent School District that Chris Paddock, the principal of Sleepy Hollow Elementary, had passed away.</p><p>Paddock started his career at AISD in 2001 and was described as an inspirational leader, a helpful mentor, and a friend in a post that was made public on Facebook by AISD. The Amarillo Independent School District (AISD) provided the following statement: “The Amarillo ISD family grieves with the students, staff, and families of Sleepy Hollow Elementary and with many others in the Amarillo community who knew and loved Principal Chris Paddock.</p><p>” Our thoughts and prayers are with Chris’s wife, who is also a teacher in the AISD, as well as with their children. How many fist bumps are you able to give your team today?” How many fist bumps can you offer your children in a row? How many of your grins are you willing to lend to others who have misplaced their own on that particular day? Paddock shared with AISD his conviction that “if you value people and we have that relationship where we can talk about anything, then we can get through it together.” According to the officials, they are aware that “The start of the new school year will be difficult for Sleepy Hollow Elementary School and for our AISD family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwr8eroKxloJaxpbvCpGSompmpwqK%2B2GaYppminrmtu4ytr2asmJp6sb7Ip5qiqJGherCyjJqgrJxdqLmmsc%2ByZKGnnKG8uHnEpZymnZ6prrPFjKyaoaefoXqltcSsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
