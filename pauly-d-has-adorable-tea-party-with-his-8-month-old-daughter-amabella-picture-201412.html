"But the second I saw the baby her eyes just lit up, it's almost like she knew," he gushed. "It was amazing. I knew she was mine right off the bat too because she looks just like me. She came right over to me and put her arms right up to me. [She] grabbed my hair! That's the first thing she went for. And then she was biting my nose."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added: "I didn't know what to expect, and then you know, it's almost like I knew what to do.
