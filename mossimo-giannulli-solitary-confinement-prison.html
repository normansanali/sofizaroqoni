His adult son <strong>Gianni Giannulli</strong>&nbsp; — from the designer’s first marriage — claims his dad has spent the past 30 days since arriving in isolation, and that it is causing “mental and physical damage” to the 57-year-old. Gianni made the claims in a Dec. 17 Instagram stories post, which <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC News</a> screen-grabbed from his private IG account.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Since his arrival, Mossimo has allegedly spent 30 days in isolation in Central California’s Lompoc, which is procedure for incoming inmates as part of strict COVID-19 protocols. Those were enacted in California prisons after widespread breakouts of the coronavirus infected staff and inmates in the spring of 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mossimo-Giannullis-Son-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“He has been locked in solitary confinement in a quarantine in the MEDIUM security prison in a cell for one full month today. Only let out every three days for a few moments to shower,” Gianni wrote on an IG stories slide, also noting that his dad was supposed to serve his time in a minimum security camp. <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> has reached out to Mossimo’s rep about his son’s claims.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“The mental and physical damage being done from such isolation and treatment is wrong,” Gianni continued, adding that his dad is facing 20 more days in isolation. Mossimo’s wife, actress &nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lori Loughlin</strong></a>, 56, spent the first two weeks of her two month prison sentence in quarantine at FCI Dublin, after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reporting to the women’s facility</a> outside of the San Francisco Bay Area on Oct. 30.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mossimo-Giannullis-Son-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The couple are serving their sentences concurrently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>after pleading guilty</a> for their part in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal. The former Full House star and her husband allegedly paid a college recruiter $500K to secure admission for their daughters <strong>Isabella</strong>, 22, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olivia Jade</strong></a>, 21, to the University of Southern California <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>as crew recruits</a>, even though neither of the girls were student athletes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Olivia Jade finally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>broke her silence</a> about the scandal during a Dec. 8 episode of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong></a>‘s Facebook Watch show Red Table Talk. “What happened was wrong and I think that every single person in my family can be like, that was messed up, that was a big mistake,” the YouTube star admitted, before saying she deserves redemption. “But I think what’s so important to me is to learn from the mistake, not to now be shamed and punished and not given a second chance. Because I’m 21, I feel like I deserve a second chance to redeem myself, to show I’ve grown.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>As for her parents being locked up,&nbsp;“It’s been hard,” Olivia admitted. “I think for anybody, no matter what the situation is, you don’t want to see your parents go to prison, but also I think it’s necessary for us to move on and move forward.” The YouTuber added that she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hadn’t spoken to either of her parents</a> as of that time, “There’s a quarantine phase because of COVID, so I think that’s the reason, but I haven’t heard anything. I’m just waiting” Olivia told hosts Jada,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Willow Smith</strong></a>, and <strong>Adrienne Banfield-Norris</strong>. She added, “I’m super close with my parents, especially my mom. She’s my best friend, so it’s definitely been hard not being able to talk to her. But I know she’s strong.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5BxZqano6i2rruMoKCapp6qua21jKympaGklr%2B6ecKopZ%2Bhnpq6prrTZqeroaOku3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
