The evidence? JC Chasez was on a private jet. The other boys were inexplicably in New York City â€” it was Fashion Week, after all. Well, as soon as the show started, everyone was vindicated: the boys were in the house after more than two decades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">20 years ago, they accepted their first VMA for "Bye Bye Bye" and they were at tonight's show to present the award for Best Pop Video.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Thank you MTV and especially all you guys for always supporting your favorite musical artists," Chasez said during his time at the mic. The whole group was in attendance, including Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, and Joey Fatone.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Noam Galai/Getty Images for MTV</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The award went to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a>&nbsp;and her song "Anti-Hero." She was clearly shaken when the boys walked out and understandably freaked out as soon as she got her trophy from them.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm not doing well pivoting from this to this," Swift said before looking at the boy band in disbelief. "I had your dolls. Are you doing something? What's going to happen now? They're going to do something and I need to know what it is. You're pop personified so to receive this from you golden pop hands is really too much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Best Pop Video was just one of the nominations Swift had for the night, so she can rest easy for the remainder of the show and bask in the afterglow of getting to be within arm's reach of NSYNC knowing she's a winner on multiple fronts.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zaywp5tdp7K2usiopWZqYGeAbrnTr2SvpZGoeniFlXFwcW8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
