The operation, considered one of the most complex in history, was conducted in Rio de Janeiro under the leadership of UK paediatric surgeon Noor ul Owase Jeelani.</p><p>The boys, aged 3 years old, endured multiple extensive surgeries involving nearly 100 medical professionals.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Conjoined twins with fused brains separated by surgeons in Brazil (Photos)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center border=0 hspace=0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699498280_61_Conjoined-twins-with-fused-brains-separated-by-surgeons-in-Brazil.webp.webp vspace=0></p><p>Bernardo and Arthur are currently in recovery, nearly two-and-a-half years after their parents brought them to the hospital for surgery. Images document their journey, showing the brothers before and after the separation, with one picture capturing them separated on a hospital bed, bandaged up and holding hands.</p><p>The surgical team was led by Mr. Jeelani and Dr. Gabriel Mufarrej, head of pediatric surgery at Instituto Estadual do Cerebro Paulo Niemeyer. Mr. Jeelani expressed that the separation was a remarkable achievement for the medical team and emphasized the importance of public donations for the charity to continue its crucial work.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Conjoined twins with fused brains separated by surgeons in Brazil (Photos)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center border=0 hspace=0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1699498281_746_Conjoined-twins-with-fused-brains-separated-by-surgeons-in-Brazil.webp.webp vspace=0></p><p>He stated, “The successful separation of Bernardo and Arthur is a remarkable achievement by the team in Rio and a fantastic example of why the work of Gemini Untwined is so valuable. Not only have we provided a new future for the boys and their family, we have equipped the local team with the capabilities and confidence to undertake such complex work successfully again in the future. It is through this process of teamwork and knowledge-sharing globally that we can hope to improve the outcome for all children and families that find themselves in this difficult position.”</p><p>The monumental task was supported by Gemini Untwined, a charity founded by Mr. Jeelani to raise funds for siblings born conjoined at the head, also known as craniopagus twins. The charity affirmed that the separation of Bernardo and Arthur was one of the most intricate processes ever completed and was deemed unachievable by many surgeons.</p><p>As the twins approach four years of age, they also hold the record for being the oldest craniopagus twins with a fused brain to undergo successful separation. Both brothers are recuperating well in the hospital and are expected to undergo six months of rehabilitation with the charity’s support.</p><p>Prior to the seven operations, surgeons spent months experimenting with various techniques in virtual reality to ensure a successful outcome during the intricate surgery.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiaqKaapLavscNmq7Chnqh6uLXToWSfraOasW6u0Zqgp6tdqLKxrdGaq56cXZfGbr%2FUq56ep56oeqq6jJupmrKZoXqxtM6tpqxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
