Entertainment, music, media, fashion, and the arts, you name it, it’s hard not to fall in love with the city of lights. Well, Kacey Margo was just one of the few ladies featured on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Real</span></i> <i><span style=font-weight:400>Girlfriends in Paris</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, determined to make it work in Paris.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Let’s get to know her better as this Kacey Margo Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Kacey Margo On Bravo’s RGIP (Real Girls In Paris)</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unlike other shows that exaggerated, glamorized, and romanticized the Parisian lifestyle, Bravo’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Real</span></i> <i><span style=font-weight:400>Girlfriends in Paris</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> showcased all the highs and lows women went through as they adjusted to their respective situations in Paris. Be it navigating dating woes or job obstacles or even culture shock, the audience was in for a ride as if they were the ex-pats themselves.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Kacey, it was the “help” she never received from the locals. Although she believed the city was the perfect next chapter to take chances, all she received from the French people was “empathy.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“People come to the bar and you will be like, ‘I don’t have any money. I’m really struggling’ and they’ll be like, ‘you can have coffee, you can have water, we have (a) sandwich for you,’” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Initially, Kacey traveled to Paris while taking time off for a semester in college. Bitten by the Parisian bug, she then secured a temporary role as an English teacher in a French classroom. But sadly, she was having some issues with her visa and some instability in her work — threatening her dreams of living abroad.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Kacey for the inaugural season of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Real</span></i> <i><span style=font-weight:400>Girlfriends in Paris</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> were co-stars — Anya Firestone, Emily Gorelik, Margaux Lignel, Adja Toure, and Victoria Zito.</span></p><h3><b>Kacey Margo Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo was 26 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Real</span></i> <i><span style=font-weight:400>Girlfriends in Paris</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She was one of the younger cast that season.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Kacey Margo Parents?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo was born to her parents, Alan Wilson, and an anonymous mother.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her father, Alan is a Houston, Texas native who attended </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Lamar High School, Harvard Business School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and later studied Civil engineering at the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (MIT).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her siblings, Kacey has an older brother named </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Austin Wilson</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> (who turned 30 on February 8, 2022) and a sister named </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Sloane Wilson</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> (who is a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Stanford University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> graduate).</span></p><p><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Here</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>’s her family photo.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><strong>Trivia:</strong> Kacey’s paternal grandmother Mary Ann Lancaster Wilson passed away n December 31, 2018, following a brief illness, at the age of 92.</span></p><h3><b>Kacey Margo Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo stands tall at a height above 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mentioning her distinct features, Kacey has dark eyes and hair, a triangular face, and a fit body.</span></p><h3><b>Kacey Margo Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo is an English teacher at a Teaching Assistant Program in France. Though this wasn’t what she dreamed of, it was how she kept her dream of living in France alive.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prior to this, Kacey worked as an artist assistant at</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> the Los Angeles County Museum of Art </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>from June 2015 to July 2017.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, from June – August 2015, Kacey toook on the job as a content marketing intern at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Center Theatre Group</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.

So, this was probably what Kacey earned as well.</span></p><h3><b>Kacey Margo Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo didn’t have a boyfriend in 2022. She celebrated her Valentine that year with a human-sized teddy bear.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“💓🧸🍫! #bearly found a #valentine in time this year!!! also: #chocolate can fix anything your therapist can’t,” she posted an IG pic with the lucky bear on Feb 16.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her ex-boyfriend, he dumped her right after she moved to Paris. “The guy I was with was like, ‘I don’t do long distance’ and I was like, ‘that’s so weird because you’re in Pittsburgh and I’m in LA,’” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thereafter, Kacey was “super over dating in general and being in a relationship.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But as much as Kacey hates him now, she still hasn’t deleted tweets related to him (at the time of writing this article). To summarize, Kacey mentioned that her boyfriend was always excited to meet her, he mixed up Anne Frank and Aunt Jemima, and he once “wanted space” in May 2018 as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, she shared that he asked her not to be sex trafficked (while in Paris) because he wasn’t Liam Neeson (</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Taken</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> movie reference).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>When Is Kacey Margo Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey celebrates her birthday on October 10 and is of the Libra zodiac.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Is Kacey Margo On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>kaceymargo</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s her TikTok @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>kaceymargo</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>kaceymargo</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>kaceymargo</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, and Soundcloud @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>kacey-margo-wilson</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Kacey Margo From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey hails from South Carolina Native.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But as of 2022, she split her time between Paris, L.A., and New York.</span></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpJmTmsZuucCrnqhlkp68bq3GnmSbp6mbv6qxzZ1kp52kYsSwvtOhZJuqkau8tHnRoKCpZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
