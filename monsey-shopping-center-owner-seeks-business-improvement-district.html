The shopping center would be the biggest contributor, he said.</p><p>Brachfeld is also hoping to build a 600-unit housing development next to his Route 59 property, according to a report by lohud.com.</p><p>There are currently no such districts in Rockland -- Pearl River considered, but rejected forming one -- but in Westchester, across the river, there are three – in Yonkers, Peekskill and White Plains.</p><p>Through his attorney, Ryan Karben, the businessman has asked Ramapo to start the process of forming the district, but, to date, town officials have not responded.</p><p>The town would have to invoke Article 19A of the General Municipal Law to get the ball rolling, Karben said.</p><p>The process includes convening a meeting of potential members to discuss the boundaries, mission and budget of the BID.</p><p>“Downtown Monsey is a thriving residential and commercial community and a BID will bring sharper focus to the need for a fully ammenitized commercial district, potentially including litter patrol, first in class landscaping and improvements to pedestrian safety,” Karben’s letter to the town said.</p><p>The proposed district’s boundaries could run along both sides of Route 59 from the Ramapo/Spring Valley border on the east (Atrium Plaza) to Remsen Avenue on the west.</p><p>The BID could also extend north from the Route 59/Route 306 intersection to Maple Avenue, Karben said.</p><p>Michael Tauber, manager of the 15-store Monsey Mall on Route 59 said he thinks a BID “would strengthen and uplift” the downtown area.</p><p>He added he was looking forward “to participating in this exciting community endeavor."</p><p>Karben cited a study done by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Policy that found that, in general, BIDs do increase the “vitality and attractiveness of their communities."</p><p>But, the center also said its findings indicate that the overall effect of a BID depends on its size, location and “mix of properties.”</p><p><a href=#>To read the Furman Center report, click here.</a></p><p><a href=#>To read the lohud.com story, click here.</a></p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn data-testid=bottom-paragraph><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button data-testid=article-click-here-to-subscribe href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Ramapo and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC6xLBksqeioHyzrcyap6hnkqrAqrrErKpopZ%2BjwKbFjKyfqKignruoecKepa2domK8uLrEq2SsnZWgwG6u1Kygp52jqHqquc%2Brpq%2BdnZq7tXnDoqqtqpmYwXCCmG1rbGpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
