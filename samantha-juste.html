Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Samantha Juste was born on <strong>May 31, 1944, </strong>in Manchester, England. Sandra Slater is her full name, and Sammy is her nickname. Similarly, she was born under the sign of Gemini.</p><p>Samantha was born to Leslie and Phylis Slater. Her father had a tailoring business. Aside from that, there is no information about her siblings or other family members. Samantha Juste, a tall, long-legged blonde, rose to prominence as a teen model.</p><p>Samantha, according to her educational background and qualification, studied textile and dress design at Rochdale College of Art. However, the names of her elementary and high schools are unknown. Samantha Juste suffered a stroke while sleeping on February 2, 2014. She died on February 5, 2014, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 69.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td>Full Name:</td><td>Samantha Juste</td></tr><tr><td>Age:</td><td>27 years</td></tr><tr><td>Birthday:</td><td>31 May</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality:</td><td>British</td></tr><tr><td>Horoscope:</td><td>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status:</td><td>Divorce</td></tr><tr><td>Divorce:</td><td>Micky Dolenz</td></tr><tr><td>Death Date:</td><td>February 5, 2014</td></tr><tr><td>Profession:</td><td>TV Show Host</td></tr><tr><td>Kids:</td><td>One (Ami Bluebell Dolenz)</td></tr><tr><td>Father:</td><td>Phylis Slater</td></tr><tr><td>Mother:</td><td>Leslie</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Samantha_Juste_Single_Relationship_Boyfriend>Is Samantha Juste Single? Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Micky Dolenz, the drummer, recalled seeing Samantha Juste as he walked past a studio cafeteria. Similarly, Samantha and Micky began dating, prompting headlines such as “Samantha traps Monkee” and “Pops girl goes ape.”</p><p>Dolenz also appears to have been unaware that Juste was a celebrity, and the publicity caught him off guard. Furthermore, Samantha was reviled by some of the Monkees’ female fans during “Monkeemania.”</p><p>Micky Dolenz claimed they stayed in her London flat for a week. Juste and Dolenz spent the majority of 1967 together in England and California. She also left “Top of the Pops” and moved to California with Dolenz, where they lived in Laurel Canyon in the Hollywood Hills. They went to the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967.</p><p>Samantha Juste married Micky Dolenz in July 1968. Dr. Robert Scott, Micky’s stepfather, officiated. Ami Bluebell Dolenz, the couple’s daughter, became an actress. The couple also threw parties for musicians and celebrities.</p><p>Furthermore, the Monkees disbanded in 1971, and Dolenz’s self-indulgence strained his marriage. They divorced in 1975, with Samantha Juste retaining custody of their daughter, but they reconciled as friends in the early 1990s. Similarly, she was with Micky Dolenz at Ami’s wedding to actor and martial artist Jerry Trimble in Beverly Hills in 2002.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Samantha_Juste_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Samantha Juste? Weight, Hair Color</span></h2><p>Samantha’s body measurements, including height, weight, chest size, waist size, hip size, and any other sizes, are unavailable. She did, however, have a slim build and a stunning face. She, too, had blonde hair and green eyes.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Samantha_Juste_start_her_Professional_Career>How did Samantha Juste start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Top of the Pops was a weekly half-hour music show that aired on Saturdays. Initially, it was created and produced by Johnnie Stewart. The program debuted on January 1, 1964, from a converted church in Rusholme, Manchester. On the show, Samantha Juste worked as Cecil Korea’s assistant producer.</p><p>Similarly, she took over for Denise Sampey after the first few episodes, sitting alongside the host (originally disc jockeys Alan Freeman, David Jacobs, Jimmy Savile, and Pete Murray) to place records on a turntable and apply the stylus as the artist was about to perform.</p><p>Furthermore, Simon Dee, who first hosted the show in 1966, recalled, “I got my introduction right and didn’t get too distracted by the luscious Samantha Juste, my lovely co-host.”</p><p>Some viewers thought Samantha’s ritual was inappropriate because the artists were present to perform. They were, however, miming, as the BBC made clear, and the procedure was honest. Furthermore, on one occasion, a record by “The Swinging Blue Jeans” was played at an incorrect speed.</p><p>Samantha Juste appeared briefly in two Swinging London films in 1965, “The Knack” and “How to Get It.” Richard Lester directed both films, and a 45 single was released the following year.</p><p>On “Top of the Pops,” Samantha met artists who were involved in the mid-1960s British rock boom. The “Monkees,” an American group formed for a television series of the same name, topped the British charts in January 1967 with Neil Diamond’s “I’m a Believer.”</p><p>Samantha, on the other hand, wrote articles for the adolescent magazine 16 about her time with the Monkees. Samantha Juste established her own fashion company in California before relocating to Acapulco, Mexico, in 1976.</p><p>She even taught design in Ireland before returning to Southern California and collaborating with Ami to launch Bluebell Boutique, an online jewelry store.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>TV Show Host</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Carol Smillie</a></h3>Carol Smillie estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
