His first appearance on television, in a brief uncredited role, was on an episode of <i>The Jack Benny Program</i>, which originally aired on November 4, 1951. Near the end of a comedy <a href=#>Sketch</a> on that episode, Easton, who was cast as a hillbilly, is confronted by another irate mountain man, and the two exchange rifle fire. In 1955, during the first season of the long-running television Western <i>Gunsmoke</i>, he played Chester Goode's younger, prairie-wandering brother in an episode titled "Magnus". He also appeared on several episodes of <i>The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show</i> on CBS in 1957-1958, playing Brian McAfee, a dimwitted student at the University of Southern <a href=#>California</a>. While living in <a href=#>England</a> for several years in the early 1960s, Easton performed too on a variety of <a href=#>British</a> television and radio programs. In 1962 he was cast in the second episode of <i>The Saint</i>, "The Latin Touch", with Roger Moore; and he also provided the voices of "X-2-Zero" and "Phones" in Gerry and <a href=#>Sylvia</a> Anderson's Supermarionation series <i>Stingray</i>. Upon returning to the United States in late 1964, Easton resumed his acting on <a href=#>American</a> television. In "All-Star Munster", a 1965 episode of <i>The Munsters</i>, he was cast yet again as a dimwitted country character named Moose Mallory, a college basketball star. He appeared as well on ABC's World War II drama <i>Combat!</i>, portraying an ill-fated soldier, Woody Jones, in the 1967 episode "A Little Jazz". The following are just a few of the other series in which Easton performed: <i>Screen <a href=#>Directors</a> Playhouse</i>, <i>Dangerous Assignment</i>, <i>My Little Margie</i>, <i>Adventures of Superman</i>, <i>Annie Oakley</i>, <i>The Bob Cummings Show</i>, <i>Riverboat</i>, <i>The Real McCoys,</i> <i>Rescue 8</i>, <i>Father Knows Best</i>, <i>The Red Skelton Show</i>, <i>Wagon Train,</i> <i>Rawhide</i>, <i>The Andy Griffith Show</i>, <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i>, <i>Petticoat Junction</i>, <i>Get Smart</i>, <i>The Doris Day Show</i>, <i>The Mod Squad</i>, <i>Alias Smith and Jones</i>, and <i>Kolchak: The Night Stalker</i>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeipK%2BmvtNmnJqrpKS7brrErWSwp6KptW6CmG1scQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
