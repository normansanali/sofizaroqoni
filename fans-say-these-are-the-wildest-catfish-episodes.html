What if two people were chatting online or texting for a period of months, or even years? It would definitely be even more nerve-wracking to meet up... especially if one person was lying about their identity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>MTV's popular reality series&nbsp;Catfish&nbsp;is all about trying to match a "hopeful" with the "catfish" (or, in rare cases, someone who is exactly who they say that they are). <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Max Joseph quit the show</a> several seasons in&nbsp;and now Nev Schulman is co-hosting with Kamie Crawford.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nev has a high net worth after hosting Catfish</a>&nbsp;and he has definitely been part of some&nbsp;intense and dramatic&nbsp;episodes. Which are the&nbsp;wildest episodes of&nbsp;Catfish, according to fans? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=lucille-amp-kid-cole>"Lucille & Kid Cole"</h2><p>After Max Joseph decided to leave, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nev had some other co-hosts on the show</a>. Some of the most intense moments on the show were definitely from the earlier seasons when Nev and Max were working together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan shared in a Reddit thread that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">season 3 episode&nbsp;called "Lucille & Kidd Cole"</a> is one that they always think about. They wrote, "The Kidd Cole episode where Nev throws his phone in the lake. Best moment ever lol."</p><p>This episode is memorable not only for the dramatic relationship but because Nev did get upset and throw a phone in a nearby body of water.</p><p>Kidd Cole was a very intense catfish, and he said that he was a rapper and music producer who had great connections in the music industry. According to&nbsp;Bustle, he told Lucille, the "hopeful," that she was going to work with Kanye West's music label, called GOOD. She gave him a lot of money and nothing ever happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Channel Guide's recap of&nbsp;the episode, this was a really tough situation as Kidd Cole put Lucille in a terrible position. Kidd's manager, Miguel, said that she had to shell out a ton of cash because later, she would be paid $70,000 annually to work with Kanye's record company. She then had the scary realization that while she had hired other people, Kidd would never pay them, and she was on the hook.</p><p>Nev and Max found out Kidd Cole's real name and saw&nbsp;that the catfish was pretending to be both Kidd and Miguel.</p><p>After Nev, Max, and Lucille met up with Kidd Cole, he was disrespectful and didn't seem to think that he did anything wrong. He wouldn't stop looking at his cell phone and that was when Nev threw it in the lake. This is a super dramatic&nbsp;Catfish&nbsp;moment so it's no wonder that fans mention this moment a lot. A fan wrote on Reddit, "I wish Nev could tell us the exact date and time of that phone chuck so I could work out what I was doing at that iconic moment in history."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Did Someone Pretend To Be Lance Bass On ‘The Circle’?</a></span></p><h2 id=kayla-and-courtney>"Kayla And Courtney"</h2><p>A fan shared on Reddit that one of the wildest episodes of&nbsp;Catfish&nbsp;was definitely the fifth season episode "Kayla And Courtney." They wrote, "One of the few 'Catfish' episodes that doesn’t focus on a romantic relationship. It features psychics and dead people. No spoilers, but it was pretty wild."</p><p>Some fans of the show wonder if this episode was real, and there are several Reddit threads devoted to discussing that.</p><p>Viewers were curious about what was really going on when&nbsp;they learned the story of this episode. Courtney contacted Kayla, whose dad passed away when she was a kid and said that she was a medium and could help her have contact with her father again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kayla felt that Courtney was telling the truth since she was aware of a lot of things&nbsp;about the family no stranger could know. According to a recap post on&nbsp;Tamratattles.com, Max said that he needed to take a break during this episode, which was rare, and he also said he thought that Courtney was for real. This is a big deal as Max was&nbsp;often skeptical on the show.</p><p>When it comes to ghosts and mediums, some people believe and others don't, so it's hard to say what really happened. Everyone does agree that this was a pretty crazy episode, though.</p><p>Max told&nbsp;The Daily Star&nbsp;that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this episode surprised him the most</a>. Max said, "I still can't wrap my mind about what happened and I still don't have a clear answer." Max continued, "We were all very skeptical, but by the end of the episode we were almost all convinced that Courtney was really communicating with Kayla's father."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s The Origin Story Of Netflix’s ‘The Circle’</a></span></p><h2 id=spencer-and-katy>"Spencer And Katy"</h2><p class=_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM>Another season 5 episode deserves a mention: "Spencer And Katy." This one is about a guy named Spencer who said that he was talking to Katy Perry. This was mentioned on Reddit a few times as a wild episode and a fan said, "Honestly nothing will compare to Spencer and Katy."</p><p class=_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM>Spencer believed that they had been dating for years and he had an engagement ring for her. Max and Nev went to England to crack the case, and when they found a girl who was catfishing him, Spencer had a hard time believing that it really wasn't Katy Perry.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How ‘The Circle’s U.S. Version Different From The U.K. Show?</a></span></p><p>These are definitely some intense&nbsp;Catfish&nbsp;episodes, and fans wonder what will happen next on the show.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How ‘The Circle’ Season 1 Winner, Joey Sasso Spent His Winnings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsCixYytn56rlWKus7GMrZ%2BeZaeeuaWx0q1knJmkm7a0tIyep6Krn5mytHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
