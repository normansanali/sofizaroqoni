But in March, that changed. All of a sudden, we were eating every meal at home, every day.</p><p class=p1>Obviously, I love cooking. But prepping breakfast, lunch, and dinner for both of us (and doing the dishes afterward) takes up a lot of time. Luckily, I signed up for Daily Harvest, a subscription service that delivers thoughtfully-sourced, chef-crafted foods to your door, over the winter. I’d been obsessed with their superfood smoothies from the get-go, and this spring, Jack and I got hooked on their harvest bowls, oat bowls, and chia bowls, soups, flatbreads, and scoops, too!</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/daily-harvest/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DSC00682.jpg&description=Daily+Harvest+New+Scoops+and+Flatbreads")'></span></span></p><h2>An Easy, Healthy Meal for Any Time of Day</h2><p>Even though the meals come frozen, they taste unbelievably fresh. The ingredients are super high quality, and the flavor combinations are exciting and unique. We love how easy it is to heat up a healthy lunch, but the meals are also handy because we’ve been limiting trips to the grocery store over the last few months. Even if we haven’t been shopping in over a week, I know that I can enjoy a wholesome meal made with fresh fruits and vegetables at any time of day.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In the morning, I love to blend up the Black Sesame and Banana Smoothie or the Carrot and Cinnamon Smoothie (it tastes like <a href=#>carrot cake</a>!) for breakfast. At lunchtime, I typically grab a bowl like the Sweet Potato and Wild Rice Hash or the Beet and Avocado Poké Bowl. Lately, I’ve also been enjoying Daily Harvest’s newest offerings: their flatbreads and scoops!</span></p><p class=p1>Use the code <a href=#><span class=s1><b>LOVEANDLEMONS</b></span></a> for $25 off your first box!</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/daily-harvest/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DSC00696.jpg&description=Daily+Harvest+New+Scoops+and+Flatbreads")'></span></span></p><h2>New Daily Harvest Flatbreads</h2><p>If I’m not in the mood for a bowl, the flatbreads are a great lunch option. They heat up in about 20 minutes in the oven, and they’re totally gluten- and dairy-free! Our favorites are the Kale and Sweet Potato and the Spinach and Artichoke. That one has a broccoli crust and tastes like <a href=#>Spinach Artichoke Dip</a>. Yum!</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/daily-harvest/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DSC00774-cropped.jpg&description=Daily+Harvest+New+Scoops+and+Flatbreads")'></span></span></p><p>After the flatbreads bake, I like to sprinkle on a few fresh herbs from our little back deck garden.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/daily-harvest/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DSC00709.jpg&description=Daily+Harvest+New+Scoops+and+Flatbreads")'></span></span></p><h2>Daily Harvest Scoops</h2><p>If we’re craving something sweet for dessert, we pull out the Scoops! Even though they’re treats, they’re made with wholesome, plant-based ingredients like avocado, fresh fruit, and/or cacao.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/daily-harvest/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DSC00735.jpg&description=Daily+Harvest+New+Scoops+and+Flatbreads")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/daily-harvest/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_28919.jpg&description=Daily+Harvest+New+Scoops+and+Flatbreads")'></span></span></p><p>We like all the flavors, but I especially love the Strawberry + Rich, Rippled Berry Compote. It’s so good that I hide it at the bottom of the freezer where Jack can’t find it! It’s the PERFECT <span style=font-weight:400>refreshing, healthy treat for warm summer days.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Chocolate + Ooey, Gooey Midnight Fudge is also fantastic. Its base is a combination of coconut and avocado, so it’s super fudgy, delicious, and decadent.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Every time you get a weekly or monthly Daily Harvest delivery, you can customize it with 9, 14, or 24 items. I’m definitely going to add an extra pint (or two) of the Strawberry Scoops to my next box!</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/daily-harvest/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_28817-cropped-3.jpg&description=Daily+Harvest+New+Scoops+and+Flatbreads")'></span></span></p><p>If you’re looking for an easy way to add healthy foods to your daily routine, try Daily Harvest! Jack and I have raved about it so much that his sister has started getting deliveries. He eats anything, I eat mostly vegan, and she’s keto. Still, we all have meals we love. We often video chat about what we’ve tried recently (the Broccoli Rice Pilaf is her favorite bowl!).
