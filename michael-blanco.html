Michael Corleone Blanco was born in Medelln, Colombia, on August 5, 1978. Leo is his zodiac sign.

Michael used to run from one corner to the next as a kid, trying to remain one step ahead of his motherâ€™s adversaries and drug dealers.</p><h2>Is Griselda, his mother, a criminal?</h2><p>Griselda murdered her three husbands. Michaelâ€™s father, Dario, was assassinated by Michaelâ€™s mother because he was attempting to acquire full custody of Michael. In the early 1970s, Griselda Blanco became involved in the cocaine trade. La Madrina, the Black Widow, and the Queen of Narco-Trafficking are some of her pet names. She went on to become the first female billionaire criminal and the deadliest woman in history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Griselda_Blanco_Medellin.jpg><p>Griselda assisted her boss in kidnapping a youngster at the age of 11 and promptly executed him after his wealthy family refused to pay the ransom. She was a pickpocket and a prostitute, to boot. Michaelâ€™s mother led a multimillion-dollar drug trafficking operation with aplomb. Finally, on September 3, 2012, Griselda died in Medelln, Colombia. A biker shot her twice, once in the head and once in the shoulder, to kill her.</p><p>Blanco also bribed correctional authorities and directed her motherâ€™s followers through their to-do list. She was openly bisexual and murdered her three marriages.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>He worked as his motherâ€™s aide in some capacity since he was a child.
