It puts some serious strain on the wallet, but the followers of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Steve Wozniak</strong> </a>and Steve Jobs’ company, founded in conjunction with&nbsp;Ronald Wayne, are passionate about their tech. And, in their opinions, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple produces the best products</a> on the market.</p><p data-characters=669 data-current-count=1050 data-injectable=true>That claim is up to debate, of course, particularly by the loyal Android users struggling to read this on their glitchy phones, but a huge bulk of the population <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prays to the Apple gods</a>, and buys up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">each fresh product</a> the company puts out. Steve Jobs isn’t profiting off the company’s success anymore, unfortunately, but — though he is no longer in a traditional role at the company — Steve Wozniak is still attached to the Apple brand. He reportedly still held a ceremonial position within the company as of 2020, which should make his impending medical bills — the tech pioneer was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hospitalized in Mexico</a> in early November — much easier to manage.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Not that medical bills should daunt one of the men behind Apple, one of the most profitable companies on the planet. The company was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worth a full $122.03 billion</a> in 2022, after all, so Wozniak should be absolutely rolling in cash.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-steve-wozniak-s-age-and-net-worth data-injectable=false>Steve Wozniak’s age and net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SteveWozniak.jpg><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Wozniak’s hospitalization in Mexico sparked concern across the Apple co-founder’s fanbase, but the 73-year-old still has plenty more good years in him. He’s getting up there, sure, but — considering the culprit behind his hospitalization doesn’t seem serious — he’ll likely recover just fine.</p><p data-characters=608 data-current-count=934 data-injectable=true>Which leaves the man with plenty of time to enjoy that nest egg. Its not nearly so impressive as it should be, considering the tens of billions of dollars Apple is worth now, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but $10 million</a> still isn’t anything to scoff at. Its shockingly low when compared to Jobs’ net worth at the time of his death, however, which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates at more than $10 billion. To be fair, Wozniak left the company in the mid-’80s, after which it became the insanely profitable behemoth it is now, which likely restricted him from raking in the massive amounts of cash Jobs eventually earned.</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>Still, $10 million is a solid number for a 73-year-old to boast. He’s got a cozy retirement ahead of him, and one he well-earned through his groundbreaking work in tech.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZGlva2xjJymZp6fqrulsdFmqq2dppp6uLvZp6Cao6NirqixjJqlnWWemsFuw86rq6Fn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
