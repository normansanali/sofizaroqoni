"I was staying at a friend's house and I had been writing Potter for six months and I stayed up when everyone else had gone to bed because I was watching the film, The Man Who Would Be King." She added: "The reason I can be incredibly precise about when I drew this was because at some point during watching that movie and drawing this picture, my mother died, 250 miles away, and I got the phone call the next day to say she had died." JK Rowling also described the character as the "most maternal or parental" of the four heads of houses at Hogwarts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/928bd06bc9fe-miriam-margolyes-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eW1xytN-h_EO data-wc=10><strong>Professor Sprout is played by&nbsp;Miriam Margolyes in the films</strong></p><p id=eO_iklrz0jfl><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>MORE:&nbsp;JK Rowling has a never-before-seen manuscript in her wardrobe</a></p><p id=eYtx3kHg2eyj data-wc=88>The sketch of Professor Sprout, along with other original notes and memorabilia by JK Rowling, are on display at the 'History Of Magic' exhibition at the British Library to celebrate 20 years since the first book: was released.
