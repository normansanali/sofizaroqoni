While looking at her chic cropped hairstyle on a 2000 issue, the Monster Ball star revealed that this look made her feel “like my best self.”</p><p>“I had no hair to hide behind, it was just all me,” she said. “Take it or leave it; love it or hate it. It was who I was.”</p><p>She went on to explain that the moment she cut her hair short was when she finally got her first job as an actor on Living Dolls. She almost directly credited this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bold beauty</a> move to her success.</p><p>“I think that’s because the directors and producers actually saw me.
