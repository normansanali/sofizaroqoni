I grew up in Hawaii, and this was my backyard. My love of the natural world began here," he says. "When I was growing up, wild spaces and everyday spaces, they were one in the same: an essential part of our lives. I wanna make sure that the world's wild spaces are there for my kids and my grandkids."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The series promises to take viewers into not only America's national parks, but also the many marvelous protected areas across the globe, and to highlight underappreciated species, which, if kept safe, could help save the planet.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the trailer for the docuseries, Barack speaks about a rare sloth that has "an entire micro-kingdom living in his fur."
