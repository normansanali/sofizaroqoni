And if it doesn’t work out, well, you know what, I’m gonna learn a lot of lessons. And I had a lot of fun along the way.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “<a href=#>When&nbsp;I was on that app</a>, I was like, ‘No, they live in a different country, no, no, no.’ And, you know, even with him, I said, ‘No … this is silly. I’m a mom with two kids and I live in Nashville, like, how would this even work?’ And something about him, you know, I was like, ‘OK, well, let me just see, what does the conversation hurt, right?’ This just feels different.”</p><p class=p1>Kramer — who was briefly linked to <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Ian Schinelli</strong> </a>in 2022 <a href=#>following her divorce from Caussin</a>&nbsp;— is remaining optimistic as she and Russell <a href=#>navigate long distances</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I’m just enjoying where it’s at right now and I’m enjoying feeling this way,” she gushed during her podcast. “We’re&nbsp;trying not to go more than three weeks without&nbsp;seeing each other. … It just feels really nice, and I don’t want to put too much pressure on it and I just want to enjoy it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Kramer confirmed in May 2023 that <a href=#>the pair are engaged</a> after six months of dating.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to meet Kramer’s man:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKm7jKKqZqKRo65ut9GapJ6qo2KvsMXFq6CeppRirq24wKdkq62jqLKtuIxuZK2gmaO0tHnTqGSkpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
