More than a year after the 38-year-old actor posted good news about his engagement with his girlfriend Miya, fresh information have just been revealed about his fiancee.<br>Miya, who after her betrothal to the “Sister, Sister” alum on Instagram has changed her name to Miyana Houston, seldom speaks on social media regarding her past or relatives. She did, however, note that Miyana Juanita Houston was her real name.</p><p>According to MTO News, a girl matching the name and picture of Marques’ fiancee was identified on the National Site for Missing Teens after a little search on Google. An adolescent girl named “Miyana Juanita Pinkney” has been reported missing in Oregon since 2016, when she was just 15 years old, according to the database. Her parents put pictures of her on the internet under “missing teen,” claiming that she had moved to California from their home in Oregon.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The definition on the website reads: “Miyana’s birth mother, Paula Harris, lost parental rights in California and Miyana was adopted in California in 2012,” “Miyana ran away from her home in Eugene, Oregon, on August 6, 2016, at 8:00 AM. It is believed Miyana is with, or traveling to, her birth mother, Paula Harris, or maternal grandmother, Barbara Dotson, in California.”<br>She supposedly replied to the reports with a mysterious post on her Instagram page after Miya’s supposed history emerged online. Let you be measured by strangers,”Let people judge you,” “Let them misunderstand you. Let them gossip about you. What they think of you isn’t your problem. Their opinions do not pay your bills.”</p><p>“So you stay kind, committed to love, and free in your authenticity, and no matter what they do or say… never doubt your worth of the beauty of your truth. You keep on shining and let the haters hate.”So in your authenticity, you remain kind, committed to love, and free, and no matter what they do or say… never doubt your worth of the beauty of your truth. You continue to shine and let the haters hate it.</p><p>If the news is real, that suggests that when she was 17 or 18 years old, Marques began dating Miya. They met while visiting the services of Jehovah’s Witnesses and declared their Instagram relationship official in October 201The former “A Different World” star announced in March 2019 that he had raised the issue with his girlfriend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxxfY6soKeflad6rq3Rqqyeq12dvLa%2F06ilrGWWnq6vr8SeZKKrXZa5rbHGnpulsV2itrS%2FyKeeZqyVmrtvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
