As Swift later pointed out, however, the exact lyric was not mentioned.</p><p>The full phone call eventually leaked, leading to a back-and-forth between the two about what the call did and did not say.</p><p>Swift later detailed to TIME the psychological toll that the feud took on her.</p><p>“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” she said. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/%E2%80%98thanK-you-aIMee-Is-Taylor-Swifts-%E2%80%98Final-Word-for-Kim-Kardashian-Source-1.jpg><p>But, if “thanK you aIMee” is to be taken at face value, Swift came out of the feud as a stronger person.</p><p>“I built a legacy which you can’t undo,” Swift sings. “But when I count the scars, there’s a moment of truth / That there wouldn’t be this, if there hadn’t been you.”</p><p>She alters the chorus in the final verse from “f–k you, Aimee” to “thank you, Aimee,” singing, “And our town, it looks so small, from way up here / Screamed ‘Thank you, Aimee’ to the night sky / And the stars are stunning / Cause I can’t forget the way you made me heal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6yjYsGprc2kZLKnpWKuqrnEnmSiq12btq%2Bty2auqKqUYrOwvoykoKZlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
