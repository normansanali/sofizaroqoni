Created by Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli, Miles Morales was originally part of the Ultimate Universe, an alternate reality in Marvel Comics, but was transported to the mainline Marvel Comics Universe following Secret Wars in 2015. Morales has appeared in television shows, video games, and movies. He’s yet to make his live-action debut — heavy emphasis on <a href=#>yet</a>. But the new animated film finds him a year and a half into his role as Spider-Man, struggling to balance the life of a superhero (and, apparently, preserver of canon events) with that of a lonely high-schooler.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clijcr68300373b6vwvwxsbgk@published><span class=unordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>.</p></span>Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clijcju1f00313b6vsvoibrsf@published data-word-count=113>Gwen Stacy has been a key part of Spidey’s mythos since her debut in The Amazing Spider-Man No. 31 (1965) and has appeared live-action in Spider-Man 3 (2007), where she was portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard, and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), where she was portrayed by Emma Stone. But this particular version of Gwen, voiced by Hailee Steinfeld, once known in the comics as Spider-Gwen and later as Ghost-Spider and created by Jason Latour and Robbi Rodriguez, debuted in Edge of Spider-Verse No. 2 (2014). Like Miles, her origin story remains largely unchanged in the film adaptation, and she also appeared in television shows and video games.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clim55p32000n3b6vb6waeg5v@published><span class=unordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>.</p></span>Spider-Man (Peter B.

Parker, voiced by Jake Johnson, returns in Across the Spider-Verse, and this time he has his and Mary Jane’s baby in tow. This iteration of Parker is an original character for the films, previously plagued by self-doubt and a number of losses including the death of Aunt May and a divorce from Mary Jane, before rising to the challenging of becoming Miles’s mentor and repairing his marriage. He shares many similarities with the comic-book version of Peter Parker, who of course was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and made his debut in Amazing Fantasy No. 15 (1962). Mayday, on the other hand, made her debut as the teenage Spider-Girl in What If? No. 105 (1998) and was created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz. A fan favorite, Mayday has had her own comic-book series under Marvel’s MC2 imprint and also appeared in numerous Marvel video games.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clim7byd8000u3b6vwjb6iqt7@published><span class=unordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>.</p></span>Spider-Woman (Jess Drew)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clim55dyn000h3b6v9i3m29r0@published data-word-count=159>Jessica Drew, created by Archie Goodwin and Marie Severin, first appeared in Marvel Spotlight No. 32 (1977). Funny enough, she was conceived as a one-off character with no connection to Spider-Man. Initially, she was a spider who evolved into a woman (ew!), but after a retcon, her powers were the result of an experimental serum. Across the Spider-Verse’s Spider-Woman, voiced by Issa Rae, doesn’t seem to have that extra baggage in terms of her origin story. Instead, she’s presented here like she is in the 2016 comics run featuring the character: as a motorcycle-riding badass who also just so happens to be fighting crime while pregnant and serves as second-in-command to the leader of the Spider Society, Miguel O’Hara.&nbsp;Drew, who benefitted from a comics resurgence courtesy of Brian Michael Bendis as a member of the New Avengers in 2005, is set to play a role in an upcoming, still untitled Spider-Verse spinoff film focusing on a number of Spider-Women.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clim8v7is00173b6v07taf2s5@published><span class=unordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>.</p></span>Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O’Hara)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clim7m6fz00113b6vo7ytvhd3@published data-word-count=139>The Spider-Man of the future, Miguel O’Hara debuted in Spider-Man 2099 No. 1 (1992) as the creation of Peter David and Rick Leonardi. O’Hara is geneticist for the corporation Alchemax whose experimental work is sabotaged by a jealous colleague, resulting in O’Hara’s genes being spliced with those of a spider, leaving him with talons, claws, and a vampiric bloodlust. Unlike Parker, O’Hara has a much more serious demeanor and rarely seems to enjoy being Spider-Man. Those traits are carried over into Across the Spider-Verse, where O’Hara, voiced by Oscar Isaac, emerges as an antagonist who sees Miles’s existence as an anomaly and a threat to the multiverse. The character is a cult favorite, but outside of video games and an appearance on the animated series Ultimate Spider-Man, Across the Spider-Verse is his most significant introduction outside of the comics.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clim8vkrh001k3b6v50cqsymi@published><span class=unordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>.</p></span>Spider-Man (Pavitr Prabhakar)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clim8vief001e3b6vih05tg1i@published data-word-count=149>The Indian Spider-Man of Earth-50101, voiced by Karan Soni, made his debut in Spider-Man: India No. 1 (2005) and was created by Jeevan J. Kang, Suresh Seetharaman, and Sharad Devarajan. He received his spider powers from an ancient Yogi in order to prevent evil in the world. In the film, he seems to be one of the only Spider-Men whose life isn’t defined by tragedy, and he loves being Spider-Man. He’s notably only been in the role for six months; however, he has a close bond with Gwen and Spider-Punk. His “canon event” is disrupted when Miles saves Pavitr’s ally, Captain Singh. Despite the trouble this lands Miles in with Miguel, Pavitr returns the favor and joins Gwen to search for him at the end of the film. Given the breakout nature of the character, he seems destined for a larger role in the comics in the near future.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clisu6xij001x3b6vhl73p4k4@published><span class=unordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>.</p></span>Spider-Punk</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clisu56k8001r3b6vkf958hjt@published data-word-count=148>The first Hobie Brown was the original costumed villain, the Prowler, who is now most often associated with Miles’s Uncle Aaron, and who first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man No. 78 (1969). The variant version, Spider-Punk, first appeared in 2014’s The Amazing Spider-Man No. 10 as an anarchist who brought the lower class together as the Spider Army to defeat President Osborn. In the film, he’s British instead of American and aids Miles and Gwen; he quits the Spider Society after disagreeing with Miguel’s plan to let certain individuals die in “canon events”&nbsp;to preserve the multiverse, and later appears as part of Gwen’s new group at the end of the film. He’s appeared as an unlockable character in several video games, but Across the Spider-Verse is his first film appearance (voiced by Daniel Kaluuya).

The general character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man No. 149 (1975), created by Gerry Conway, but he took the name Ben Reilly in Spider-Man No. 51 (1994) and debuted as the Scarlet Spider in Web of Spider-Man No. 118 (1994). He’s most often associated with the infamous Clone Saga that ran throughout Spider-Man comics in the ’90s, which saw Reilly struggling with angst over his borrowed identity. In the film, he’s voiced by Andy Samberg, who really plays up that angst.
