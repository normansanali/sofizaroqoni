And then he would have to be worrying about me… No. If I followed him everywhere, I think there’s a risk we might stop getting along.”</p><p>However, she was a more frequent visitor at the 2020 Australian Open, and watched all of Nadal’s four-set win over Nick Kyrgios.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000463532409-1-e1562943335603.jpg> <a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SPORT-PREVIEW-Nadal-Barty.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">TOP TIPS</h3><p>French Open tennis tips: Top picks for Roland Garros as Nadal eyes 14th title</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crop-14883621.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">LEW THE MAN</h3><p>Lewis handed prestigious Laureus gong for pushing diversity & inclusion in F1</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SPORT-PREVIEW-NADAL.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">SWIMCREDIBLE</h3><p>Nadal dives into SWIMMING POOL to celebrate unreal 12th Barcelona Open triumph</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport-preview-dier-ashes-nadal.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">Spurs Till I Die-r</h3><p>Dier wants ashes scattered at Spurs stadium and says Nadal is his hero</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SPORT-PREVIEW-NADAL-HAMILTON.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">ACE RACE</h3><p>Hamilton & Nadal to fight it out for Laureus World Awards’ sportsman of the year</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SPORT-PREVIEW-Nadal-Yacht.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">LIFE’S A BREEZE</h3><p>Onboard Nadal’s amazing £4.5m yacht with jet ski garage and bar for 12 pals</p><h2>Does Xisca Perello use Twitter or Instagram?</h2><p>Xisca Perello doesn’t have any public social media channels.</p><p>However, admiring fans have set up social media accounts to share pictures.</p><p>Xisca has previously spoken out about avoiding fame and celebrity status.</p><p>She explained: “It’s not a world I want to be part of, nor do I think Rafa would have chosen to be with a woman who looked for that in life.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp528brXSZqmanpGauW66wJ2YpatdrLansYyxoKybkWK9pr7EpaOoZaedsq95w6KbZp6imruktIyop56mXWd9c32MrZynppmoerTAwKtkppmip8ZutMSrZJqmlGKxsHnToZyyZZiWw6Z5wqGgpZyimrtw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
