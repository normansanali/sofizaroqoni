He made the most of every chance to educate the community on fire safety and prevention by holding workshops and visiting schools to increase awareness about potential threats and the need of having an emergency plan in place.</p><p>LeRoy Truax, regarded as one of the most devoted members of the West Salem community, passed away, and the town is in mourning over his passing. LeRoy was a well-respected and treasured gentleman who played a big role in helping his community as a dedicated member of the West Salem Volunteer Fire Department (VFD). LeRoy was a firefighter with the West Salem VFD for many years. The vacuum that his loss has created will be difficult to fill, but his legacy of selflessness and service will be remembered for many years to come.</p><p>LeRoy Truax made an incalculable impact on the West Salem Volunteer Fire Department throughout the [Number of Years Served] years that he was a member of the department. He served the department in a variety of capacities, from being an active fireman on the frontlines to holding positions of authority within the organization. Because of his exceptional leadership qualities and his capacity to remain calm under duress, LeRoy became a role model for his fellow firefighters, and he motivated the younger generation to follow in his footsteps as a firefighter.</p><p>LeRoy Truax spent his whole childhood in the town of West Salem, and it was there that he formed a deep feeling of responsibility toward the community in which he lived.
