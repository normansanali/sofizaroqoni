Our family and friends kept requesting more chocolate and Moodygirl was born.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Moody-Girl-Inline-1.jpg><p>But just because her bars are filled with vitamins and adaptogens, doesn’t mean they’re any less tasty than your typical treat.</p><p>“People think the chocolate might taste different since it’s infused with vitamins and adaptogens. However, you cannot taste the vitamins or adaptogens in the chocolate,” Nierman explains. Moodygirl is sweet and creamy tasting and has a grainy, cookie-like texture, similar to a Mexican chocolate, because everything down to the coconut sugar is minimally processed.”</p><p>In addition to the delicious flavor, Nierman claims the chocolates helped with cramps, mood swings and hormonal headaches, which inspired her to take her original recipe (found in the <a href=#>For That Time of the Month</a> flavor) and expand it to include a <a href=#>Chill Out</a> bar, a <a href=#>Libido Lover bar</a> and a Moody Matcha bar launching this winter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Moody-Girl-Inline-2.jpg><p>“We have different chocolate bars for the different moods women experience, everything from sexy to anxious,” she notes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Moodygirl has helped me to feel overall more balanced in my life. … We created the products for the active health-conscious woman and someone who cares about the ingredients they put into their body,” Nierman shares.</p><p>And that includes A-listers. “Celebrities are naturally drawn to Moodygirl because they want to fuel their bodies with superfoods that make them feel good from within. … They recognize what they put into their bodies matters and affects the way they ultimately look, feel and perform.”</p><p>As for what you can expect: “Most people generally see results within 15 to 30 minutes after eating the chocolate. … You can enjoy them every day and on-the-go or a few times a week — really whenever you are feeling you need a little boost or have a craving,” the founder says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqWdkZ16r7XEq6Sapl2ku27Dx7JkpqecocZuv8imqmakn6uytHnMqKadsZeev615wqGmnKeclsGmv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
