He was named the ABA Playoffs MVP in 1973. He nearly averaged a triple-double in the playoffs that year (32.3 points, 15.9 rebounds, and 8.2 assists in 18 games), but the Pacers fell short of the title, losing to Kentucky in the ABA Finals.</p><p>He managed to go over to the NBA following the 1974-75 season, and he didn’t skip a beat. He made the All-NBA First Team in his debut season with the&nbsp;Philadelphia 76ers, who had originally drafted him in the 1973 NBA Draft. Teaming up with fellow ABA alumni&nbsp;Julius Erving and&nbsp;Caldwell Jones, McGinnis helped lead the Sixers to the&nbsp;NBA Finals in 1977.</p><p>He was traded to the&nbsp;Denver Nuggets&nbsp;in 1978 and was an All-Star again that season. Hoping to boost sagging attendance in their early NBA years, the Pacers re-acquired McGinnis in a trade for a young, high-scoring forward named&nbsp;Alex English. However, he was only a shadow of his former self and contributed very little during his two-year return to Indiana. Meanwhile, English went on to become one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history. This transaction is now considered among the worst trades in Pacers’ history.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-george-mcginnis></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About George Mcginnis</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-george-mcginnis></span><span>Who is George Mcginnis?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>George is an American former professional basketball player.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-george-mcginnis></span><span>How old is George Mcginnis?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>George is 70 years old as of 2020, he was born on August 12, 1950, in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States as George F.
