Join us while we go over the nutritional facts and possible risks of feeding radishes to a bearded dragon. We also included a short guide on how to serve them.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><h2><span id=Radish_Nutritional_Information_Safety><strong>Radish Nutritional Information & Safety</strong></span></h2><p>Radishes do contain nutrients that are beneficial for bearded dragons, which is why they are great occasional additions to their salad meals.</p><p>Radish Key Nutritional Information per 100 grams (3.5 oz.) :</p><ul><li><strong>Water: </strong>27 grams (g)</li><li><strong>Carbohydrates: </strong>4 g</li><li><strong>Total Fat: </strong>1 g</li><li><strong>Total Protein: </strong>68 g</li><li><strong>Fiber</strong>: 1.6 g</li><li><strong>Calcium: </strong>25 milligrams (mg)</li><li><strong>Phosphorus: </strong>20 mg</li></ul><p>Radishes are also excellent because they have very low numbers of oxalates.</p><h2><span id=Risks_Associated_With_Radishes><strong>Risks Associated With Radishes</strong></span></h2><p>Despite their benefits, radishes do have a few drawbacks that render them somewhat controversial. Their main drawbacks are as follows.</p><p><strong>Calcium-to-Phosphorus Ratio</strong></p><p>For healthy adult bearded dragons in maintenance, their diet should have a calcium-to-phosphorus ratio of anywhere between 1.5:1 and 2:1. This means the calcium should be around twice as much as the phosphorus. The recommended ratio for juveniles is around 2:1, and dragons that are breeding (particularly females) require a higher calcium intake compared to adults that are in maintenance.</p><p>In radishes, calcium is only just slightly higher than phosphorus, around 1.2:1. Such a ratio is undesirable for the long-term health of a bearded dragon. Therefore, radishes should be viewed as treats and not major components of their daily salad servings.</p><p><strong>Goitrogens</strong></p><p>Goitrogens are substances that disrupt the production of thyroid hormones, which are required for the metabolism process in a bearded dragon’s body throughout their life.</p><p>Radishes are naturally high in goitrogens, so overconsumption may disrupt a bearded dragon’s normal metabolism. Prolonged disturbances of the thyroid hormones may lead to an enlarged thyroid and a condition known as goiter.</p><h2><span id=How_Should_I_Prepare_Radishes_for_My_Bearded_Dragon>How Should I Prepare Radishes <strong>for</strong> My Bearded Dragon?</span></h2><p>Bearded dragons can consume the radish’s leaves and root (the vegetable). It is advised to mix the leafy greens of the radish plant <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>with other greens</a> that you regularly provide and make them part of your pet’s rotational salad composition.</p><p>Serve the root in moderation, about once or twice a month as part of their salad mix for the day. Before giving the leaves or root vegetables to your pet, thoroughly wash the produce to remove any chemical or pesticide residue.</p><p>Next, chop the produce into small pieces (about 1 x 1 cm in size), and mix them with other greens, vegetables, and fruits, such as kale, dandelion greens, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>peppers</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>carrots</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>apples</a>, to make a small salad. You may also sprinkle it with a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link=external>calcium and vitamin D supplement</a>. Serve it to your bearded dragon as you normally would.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64><h2><span id=i><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></h2><h2><span id=Final_Thoughts><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Final Thoughts"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4993,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial"}'>Final Thoughts</span></span></h2><p>Radishes are not poisonous or toxic for bearded dragons and are generally safe for consumption. However, their less-than-ideal calcium-to-phosphorus ratio and the presence of goitrogens mean they shouldn’t be served to your bearded dragon too frequently or in high quantities.</p><p>Still, radishes can safely be incorporated into a beardie’s diet, and in moderation, they can be fantastic additions to their culinary profile. As always, though, if you have doubts about your bearded dragon’s diet, we recommend reaching out to your exotic veterinarian for more advice.</p><p><strong>Related Reads:</strong></p><ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet" data-stringify-type=unordered-list data-indent=0><li data-stringify-indent=0><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cherries?
