Now it appears he had Mike Chioda’s teeth lodged into his head during a match.</p><p>Randy Orton has been on the shelf for quite a long time due to his back injury. He was written off WWE television after being attacked by The Usos last year and fans continue to miss him.&nbsp;As previously reported,<a href=#>&nbsp;Orton underwent back fusion surgery</a>&nbsp;and things haven’t gotten better for him since then.</p><p>During his time in WWE, The Viper has competed in numerous matches over the course of his career. Many of his matches have been officiated by veteran referee Mike Chioda, who was released back in 2020.</p><p>While speaking with <a href=#>Steve Fall of Ten Count</a>, Mike Chioda revealed the time that he lost two teeth on Randy Orton’s head while officiating a match. It ended up making Orton bleed as well.</p><p>“My teeth have been in Randy Orton’s head. I remember one time, I meant to go pull them off and went down and he came up. My front two teeth were right at the top of his head and he started gushing the blood. He’s looking at me, goes, ‘You’re all right?’ I’m like, ‘My teeth are still there!’ It’s a TV match and I’m like, ‘Is my teeth still there?’ He’s like, ‘Yeah.’ I’m like, ‘Holy! You’re juicing from the top of your head!'”</p><p>Ringside News exclusively reported that <a href=#>Randy Orton’s return to the squared circle is planned</a>, but it won’t happen this Summer. We’ll have to see when The Apex Predator will return to the ring.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on this bizarre Randy Orton story?
