Stuff happens in life, and it’s okay. I’ve still got a very full life that I really adore. Please don’t make me cry.”</p><p><h3 class=ih>EMOTIONAL TOPIC</h3></p><p class=dh>Sadly, Wendy could not hold back the tears, and they flowed freely as she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lB7uqyhxzU&t=186s">continued</a>:</p><p class=dh>“I didn’t plan on this but it is what it is. …I have a very full life. Thank you for watching. I would ask you to respect our privacy, but please, I don’t respect people’s privacy, that’s why I do [the segment] ‘Hot Topics,’ so turnabout is a fair game, but all three of us are doing fine.”</p><p><h3 class=ih>FATHER-SON RELATIONSHIP</h3></p><p class=dh>Wendy, 54, added that despite the situation, her and Kevin Sr. will still be coming together to celebrate their son’s milestones.</p><p class=dh>“Kevin’s gotta graduate from college. He’s going into his sophomore year,” she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lB7uqyhxzU&t=186s">explained</a>. “He’s gonna get married and whatever he’s gonna celebrate. Everybody’s gotta grow up.”</p><p class=dh>When the photographer asked about Kevin Sr. and Jr.’s relationship, the “Wendy Williams Show” host confirmed that father and son are doing okay.</p><p class=dh>“They’re not apart,” she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lB7uqyhxzU&t=186s">said</a>. “You know stuff happens in life.”</p><p><h3 class=ih>KEVIN JR'S ARREST</h3></p><p class=dh>Last month, Kevin Jr. got into a <a class="me a" href=#>physical altercation</a> with his father allegedly over an argument about his parents’ divorce.

The TV producer, who was also his wife’s manager, reportedly <a class="me a" href=#>welcomed a child</a> with his alleged mistress in March, the same time Wendy was <a class="me a" href=#>battling addiction</a> at a sober house facility in New York.</p><p><h3 class=ih>WENDY'S NEW LIFE</h3></p><p class=dh>The TV queen has since <a class="me a" href=#>moved on</a> and recently told fans she’s <a class="me a" href=#>back on the dating scene</a>.

[He’s] a friend.”</p><p class=dh>A day later, the “Ask Wendy” author had fans reeling with a photo of herself <a class="me a" href=#>holding hands with a man</a> she described as “very sexy” while revealing she’s old enough to be his mother.</p><p class=dh>The mystery man in the picture is reportedly the same person who was sitting in the back of the car with Wendy during the teary interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b1754ec8913a109605341718358ae51610086291560277753.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Screenshot of Wendy’s photo of her mystery man. | Photo: Instagram/Wendy Williams</p><p class=dh>Wendy allegedly met him during her brief California vacation and is planning to take the alleged 20-something-year-old with her to New York.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpsb2hjZXq4sc2dsGavmaG5qq3MrGSsqJ%2BpwaawjKecsGWppMKvs8SrZJ%2BqmZq7b7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
