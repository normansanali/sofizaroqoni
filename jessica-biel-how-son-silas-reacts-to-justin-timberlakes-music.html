No big deal, whatever.’”</p><p>As for her own show Pete the Cat, Silas “will not watch” it. The Minnesota native explained during the<a href=#> Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> appearance: “Yet he says, ‘Hey, mom, hey, mom, do one of those voices from the show,’ and I’m like, ‘But you’ve never seen the show. You don’t even know.’ He’s just like, ‘Just do it, mom,’ so I’ll do one of the voices. He’ll be like, ‘Cool, mom, cool.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jessica-Biel-Reveals-How-Son-Silas-Reacts-to-Justin-Timberlake-Music-Jimmy-Fallon-The-Tonight-Show.jpg><p>The<a href=#> 7th Heaven</a> alum and Timberlake, 40, are also the parents of son Phineas, 9 months. Biel called the toddler and his big brother “besties” on Friday, gushing, “I really was worried. You just never know what’s going to happen and how your older one is going to feel about the little one. They just think each other are so funny, and it’s so amazing to watch.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jessica-Biel-Reveals-How-Son-Silas-Reacts-to-Justin-Timberlake-Music3.jpg><p>Last month, the Golden Globe nominee told<a href=#><strong> Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> that her sons “laugh at each other all day long.” Bel explained, “<a href=#>They both think the other is hilarious</a>. It is so cute to see these two together. Everything that Silas does is hilarious and then anything that Phin does is hilarious.”</p><p>The Emmy nominee celebrated <a href=#>Mother’s Day</a> with her little ones on Sunday, May 9, and Timberlake posted a touching tribute to her at the time. “Moms are the strongest people on the planet,” the “Suit & Tie” singer wrote via Instagram. “I am constantly in awe of the mothers in my life. Jess — you’re the heart of this family. Your boys look up to you and love you unconditionally. And so do I.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jessica-Biel-Reveals-How-Son-Silas-Reacts-to-Justin-Timberlake-Music-2.jpg><p>The Tennessee native previously called Biel his “favorite person” in March while <a href=#>celebrating her 39th birthday</a>. “The strongest, funniest, best, brightest and most beautiful mom/partner/BOSS there is,” the Grammy winner gushed at the time. “I’m lucky to learn from you and laugh with you and celebrate you every day. But, today we do it with [cake]. Here’s to more slow-mos in the wind, jumping into bushes to save our kid’s toys and timing out jump pics perfectly. I love you with all that I know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnaOotqStjJugnqRdnby4edKopWarmaGutHnRnpicrKNiwbB5ya6qraGeYsGqucGeqaWZm5rAbrnUrKCcZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
