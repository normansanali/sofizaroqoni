Here, we take a look at his net worth and working history.</p><figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>Monahan's last role before he joined the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/who-owns-the-pga-tour>PGA Tour</a> was working as the Executive Vice President of Fenway Sports Group, leading the sales and business development team for the property ownership and representation divisions. Along with that role, he reportedly directed their sponsorship sales operations for the Boston Red Sox, Major League Baseball Advanced Media, NASCAR’s Roush Fenway Racing and Boston College Athletics.</p><p>If we go back even further, the American spent three years working as the Executive Director at&nbsp;IMG&nbsp;Worldwide, where he played an integral role in the development of the&nbsp;Deutsche Bank Championship&nbsp;at&nbsp;TPC Boston. He was also a Director of Global Sponsorships and Branding Programs at EMC Corporation and worked at Arnold Advertising and Bob Woolf Associates.</p><p>In America, it is reported that an Executive Vice President (EVP) makes on average between $150,000 - $200,00 but, in the big business of sports marketing, this salary will likely be a bit more, especially when Fenway Sports Group are valued at a reported $10 billion.</p><figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>Having joined the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/how-many-tours-does-the-pga-tour-run>PGA Tour</a> in 2008 as Executive Director of The Players Championship, Monahan has held the position of Deputy Commissioner, Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer prior to his move to Commissioner.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest clue about Monahan's salary came in a report <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pga-tour-liv-golf-private-jet-jay-monahan-11663158688?mod=sports_lead_story">by the Wall Street Journal</a> in September 2022. In the document, it stated Monahan's use of a Tour-owned private jet for both business and personal travel, and also mentioned the Commissioner’s 2020 compensation of $14.2 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the release, the Tour told the Wall Street Journal that the yearly pay for Monahan was actually $8.3 million, with the remainder of the cash being a long-term incentive pay and also future retirement benefits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvLn6SopqSdubp6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZrCgkal6qr%2BMo5iyZZ2ku6K0wKeqZqaVqXq4u9Gtnw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
