ABC Family star <strong>Tammin Sursok</strong>, who plays Jenna on the hit series Pretty Little Liars, gave birth to a daughter on Tuesday, Oct. 8, her rep tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> exclusively.</p><p>"Phoenix Emmanuel Sursok-McEwen was born today," the rep tells Us. She weighed in at 9 pounds, 12 ounces.</p><p>This is the first child for Sursok, 30, and husband <strong>Sean McEwen</strong>, an actor/director. The couple originally confirmed her pregnancy to <strong>Us</strong> in June, saying they felt "very blessed to be having a baby" and would be "happy with either a boy or a girl." Two months later, however, the former Young and the Restless actress revealed exclusively to <strong>Us</strong> that it was the latter.</p><p>"I'm so excited to enter this new phase of our lives," the mom-to-be said at the time. "What a blessing to add a little girl to our family!"</p><p>Married since August 2011, the couple hope to add more little ones to their family soon. "We want like three or four," she said in an interview with Australian radio deejays Kyle and Jackie O earlier this year. "But a lot of Tammins running around — I don't know if the world needs anymore."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Her husband might beg to differ. On her 30th birthday this year, he shared a sweet note to his wife on Twitter. "You continue to teach me, to inspire me, to guide me, to partner with me, to support me, to love me, to allow me to love you," he wrote on Aug. 19. "I am beyond grateful that you literally fell into my life, turned me upside down, and changed me forever."</p><p>"While I will strive my entire life to give you the world, the one thing I can promise is that you will always — no matter what — have my undying heart," he continued. "Here's to a future that is sure to be full of wonderment, merriment — and best of all…is limitless."</p><p>Pretty Little Liars' special Halloween episode airs Oct. 22 at 8 p.m. on ABC Family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatmZ2itq950q6prKebYr2zsdOtsGakmanBrbGMpaCaqqNirqTA0Z6qrGWXnsOmv4yboKusmGLBsHnBmpmyZZeev615z6GmnqaZrXqmucyapa6dnGJ%2FcX2ScWhpZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
